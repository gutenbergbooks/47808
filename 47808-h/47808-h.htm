<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_FOURTH_EDITION">PREFACE TO FOURTH EDITION.</h2>

<p>A <span class="smcap">FOURTH</span> preface, Mr. Murray!!!</p>

<p>There are not sufficient materials, although there is
some fresh matter, and undeniably, many excellent
sketches, thanks to the clever artist <span class="smcap">F. W. Keyl</span>, and
the talented amateur John <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, who, contrary
to the advice of many friends, has determined that
the sword shall be his profession rather than the
pencil.</p>

<p>Well!&mdash;another party shall speak for me, and much
surprised will he be to find the duty his words are
performing; but they advocate so good a cause that
I feel sure of his forgiveness. He writes in the third
person, for we are perfect strangers to each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;r</span> has all his life been a most enthusiastic
sportsman, but never broke a dog, until a year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
ago, when he happened to come across the Major-General&#8217;s
work on &#8216;Dog-breaking.&#8217; Since then he has
trained two <i>entirely</i> on the system laid down in the
book. People say they have never before seen dogs
so well broken&mdash;certainly the owner never has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always an ardent disciple of St. Hubert, Captain
<span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;r</span> is now still more so from the increased gratification
he derives from the performance of animals
trained entirely by himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reader, why not give yourself a similar gratification?</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_THIRD_EDITION">PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.</h2>

<p>I cannot help congratulating my canine friends, &#40;and
may I not their masters also?&#41;, on the circulation of
two large impressions of this work; for I trust that
many of the suggestions therein offered have been
adopted, and that their education has consequently
been effected in a much shorter period, and with far
less punishment, than that of their forefathers.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured in the present edition to render
more complete the lessons respecting Setters and
Pointers. I have added somewhat on the subject of
Spaniels, Retrievers, and Bloodhounds. It has been
my aim, also, to give a few useful hints regarding the
rearing and preservation of Game; and I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
disappointed if the youngest of my readers does not
derive, from the perusal of what I have written, an
assurance that he need not take the field wholly
ignorant of all sporting matters, or without any knowledge
of the best method of &#8220;handling arms.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_SECOND_EDITION">PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p>When Colonel Hawker, who has been styled the
&#8220;Emperor of Sportsmen,&#8221; writes to me, &#40;and kindly
permits me to quote his words&#41;, &#8220;I perfectly agree
with you in everything you have said, and I think
your work should be preached in a series of lectures
to every dog-breaker in the profession, as all these
fellows are too fond of the whip, which hardens the
animal they are instructing, and the use of their own
tongues, which frighten away the birds you want to
shoot,&#8221; I feel some confidence in the correctness of
what I have put forth. But there may be points that
have not been noticed, and some things that require
explanation, especially as regards Spaniels and Retrievers.
In endeavouring to supply these deficiencies,
I hope my additional prosing may not send the dog-breaker
to sleep, instead of helping to make him more
&#8220;wide-awake.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center smaller">&#40;FOR FIRST EDITION.&#41;</p>

<p>My respected Publisher has suggested that a Preface
may be expected. His opinion on such a subject ought
to be law; but as I fear my readers may think that
I have already sufficiently bored them, I will beg them,
in Irish fashion, to refer any formalist, who considers
a Preface necessary, to the <i>conclusion</i> of the work,
where a statement will be found of the motive which
induced me to write.</p>

<p class="hangchap">
<a href="#para_1">1</a>. Dog-breaking an Art easily acquired.&mdash;<a href="#para_2">2</a>. Most expeditious Mode of imparting
every Degree of Education. Time bestowed determines Grade of Education.
In note, Col. Hawker&#8217;s opinion.&mdash;<a href="#para_3">3</a>. Sportsmen recommended to break in their
own Dogs.&mdash;<a href="#para_4">4</a>. Men of property too easily satisfied with badly broken Dogs.
Keepers have no Excuse for Dogs being badly broken.&mdash;<a href="#para_5">5</a>. Great Experience in
Dog-breaking, or Excellence in Shooting, not necessary. Dispositions of Dogs
vary.&mdash;<a href="#para_6">6</a>. What is required in an Instructor.&mdash;<a href="#para_7">7</a>. Early in a Season any Dog will
answer, a good one necessary afterwards. Hallooing, rating Dogs, and loud
whistling spoil Sport. In note, Age and choice of birds. Several shots fired
from Stooks at Grouse without alarming them. American Partridges and our
Pheasants killed while at roost.&mdash;<a href="#para_8">8</a>. What a well broken Dog ought to do.&mdash;<a href="#para_9">9</a>.

<div class="pageheader">ART EASILY ACQUIRED.</div>

<p id="para_1">1. Dog-breaking, so far from being a mystery, is an
art easily acquired when it is commenced and continued
on rational principles.</p>

<p id="para_2">2. I think you will be convinced of this if you will
have the patience to follow me, whilst I endeavour to
explain what, I am satisfied, is the most certain and
rapid method of breaking in your dogs, whether you
require great proficiency in them, or are contented with
an inferior education. No quicker system has yet been
devised, however humble the education may be. The
education in fact, of the peasant, and that of the future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
double-first collegian, begins and proceeds on the same
principle. You know your own circumstances, and you
must yourself determine what time you choose to devote
to tuition; and, as a consequence, the degree of excellence
to which you aspire. I can only assure you of
my firm conviction, that no other means will enable
you to gain your object so quickly; and I speak with a
confidence derived from long experience in many parts
of the world, on a subject that was, for several years,
my great hobby.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p id="para_3">3. Every writer is presumed to take some interest in
his reader; I therefore feel privileged to address you as
a friend, and will commence my lecture by strongly
recommending, that, if your occupations will allow it,
you take earnestly and heartily to educating your dogs
yourself. If you possess temper and some judgment,
and will implicitly attend to my advice, I will go bail
for your success; and much as you may now love
shooting, you will then like it infinitely more. Try the
plan I recommend, and I will guarantee that the Pointer
or Setter pup which I will, for example sake, suppose to
be now in your kennel, shall be a better dog by the end
of next season &#40;I mean a more killing dog&#41; than probably
any you ever yet shot over.</p>

<p id="para_4">4. Possibly, you will urge, that you are unable to
spare the time which I consider necessary for giving
him a high education, &#40;brief as that time is, compared
with the many, many months wasted in the tedious
methods usually employed&#41;, and that you must, perforce,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
content yourself with humbler qualifications. Be it so.
I can only condole with you, for in your case this may
be partly true; mind I only say <i>partly</i> true. But how
a man of property, who keeps a regular gamekeeper,
can be satisfied with the disorderly, disobedient troop,
to which he often shoots, I cannot understand. Where
the gamekeeper is permitted to accompany his master
in the field, and hunt the dogs himself, there can be no
valid excuse for the deficiency in their education. The
deficiency must arise either from the incapacity, or from
the idleness of the keeper.</p>

<p id="para_5">5. Unlike most other arts, dog-breaking does not
require much experience; but such a knowledge of dogs,
as will enable you to discriminate between their different
tempers and dispositions &#40;I had almost said characters&#41;&mdash;and
they vary greatly&mdash;is very advantageous.
Some require constant encouragement; some you must
never beat; whilst, to gain the required ascendancy over
others, the whip must be occasionally employed. Nor
is it necessary that the instructor should be a very good
shot; which probably is a more fortunate circumstance
for me than for you. It should even be received as
a principle that birds ought to be now and then missed
to young dogs, lest some day, if your nerves happen to
be out of order, or a cockney companion be harmlessly
blazing away, your dog take it into his head and heels
to run home in disgust, as I have seen a bitch, called
Countess, do more than once, in Haddingtonshire.</p>

<div class="pageheader">REQUISITES IN AN INSTRUCTOR.</div>

<p id="para_6">6. The chief requisites in a breaker are:&mdash;Firstly,
command of temper, that he may never be betrayed into
giving one unnecessary blow, for, with dogs as with
horses, no work is so well done as that which is done
cheerfully; secondly, consistency, that in the exhilaration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of his spirits, or in his eagerness to secure a bird,
he may not permit a fault to pass unreproved &#40;I do not
say <i>unpunished</i>&#41; which at a less exciting moment he
would have noticed&mdash;and that, on the other hand, he
may not correct a dog the more harshly, because the
shot has been missed, or the game lost; and lastly, the
exercise of a little reflection, to enable him to judge
what meaning an unreasoning animal is likely to attach
to every word and sign, nay to every look.</p>

<div class="pageheader">HALLOING SPOILS SPORT.</div>

<p id="para_7">7. With the coarsest tackle, and worst flies, trout can
be taken in unflogged waters, while it requires much
science, and the finest gut, to kill persecuted fish. It is
the same in shooting. With almost any sporting dog,
game can be killed early in the season, when the birds
lie like stones, and the dog can get within a few yards
of them; but you will require one highly broken, to
obtain many shots when they are wild. Then any incautious
approach of the dog, or any noise, would flush
the game, and your own experience will tell you that
nothing so soon puts birds on the run, and makes them
so ready to take flight, as the sound of the human voice,
especially now-a-days, when farmers generally prefer
the scythe to the sickle, and clean husbandry, large
fields, and trim narrow hedges, &#40;affording no shelter from
wet&#41; have forced the partridge&mdash;a <i>short-winged</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> bird&mdash;unwillingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to seek protection &#40;when arrived at maturity&#41;
in ready flight rather than in concealment. Even the
report of a gun does not so much alarm them as the
command, &#8220;Toho,&#8221; or &#8220;Down charge,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> usually, too, as
if to make matters worse, hallooed to the extent of the
breaker&#8217;s lungs. There are anglers who recommend
silence as conducive to success, and there are no experienced
sportsmen who do not acknowledge its great
value in shooting. Rate or beat a dog at one end of a
field, and the birds at the other will lift their heads,
become uneasy, and be ready to take wing the moment
you get near them. &#8220;Penn,&#8221; in his clever maxims on
Angling and Chess, observes to this effect, &#8220;if you wish
to see the fish, do not let him see you;&#8221; and with respect
to shooting, we may as truly say, &#8220;if you wish birds to
hear your gun, do not let them hear your voice.&#8221; Even
a loud whistle disturbs them. Mr. <span class="glue">O&mdash;&mdash;t</span> of <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;e</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
says, a gamekeeper&#8217;s motto ought to be,&mdash;&#8220;No whistling&mdash;no whipping&mdash;no noise,
when master goes out for sport.&#8221;</p>

<div class="pageheader">WHAT A DOG OUGHT TO DO.</div>

<p id="para_8">8. These observations lead unavoidably to the inference,
that no dog can be considered perfectly broken,
that does not make his point when first he feels assured
of the presence of game, and remain stationary <i>where
he makes it</i>, until urged on by you to draw nearer&mdash;that
does not, as a matter of course, lie down without any
word of command the moment you have fired, and afterwards
perseveringly seek for the dead bird in the direction
you may point out,&mdash;and all this without your once
having occasion to speak, more than to say in a low
voice, &#8220;Find,&#8221; when he gets near the dead bird, as will
be hereafter explained. Moreover, it must be obvious
that he risks leaving game behind him if he does not
hunt every part of a field, and, on the other hand, that
he wastes your time and his strength, if he travel twice
over the same ground, nay, over any ground which his
powers of scent have already reached. Of course, I am
now speaking of a dog hunted without a companion to
share his labours.</p>

<p id="para_9">9. You may say, &#8220;How is all this, which sounds so
well in theory, to be obtained in practice without great
severity?&#8221; Believe me, with severity it never can be
attained. If flogging would make a dog perfect, few
would be found unbroken in England or Scotland, and
scarcely one in Ireland.</p>

<p id="para_10">10. Astley&#8217;s method was to give each horse his preparatory
lessons alone, and when there was no noise
or anything to divert his attention from his instructor.
If the horse was interrupted during the lesson, or his
attention in any way withdrawn, he was dismissed for
that day. When perfect in certain lessons by himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
he was associated with other horses, whose education
was further advanced. And it was the practice of that
great master to reward his horses with slices of carrot
or apple when they performed well.</p>

<div class="pageheader">ASTLEY AND FRANCONI.</div>

<p id="para_11"><span class="small">11. Mons. A. Franconi in a similar manner rewards his horses.
One evening I was in such a position, at a performance of the
<i>Cirque National de Paris</i>, that I could clearly see, during the <i>Lutte
des Voltigeurs</i>, that the broad-backed horse held for the men to
jump over was continually coaxed with small slices of carrots to
remain stationary, whilst receiving their hard thumps as they
sprang upon him. I could not make out why the horse was
sniffing and apparently nibbling at the chest of the man standing
in front of him with a rein in each hand to keep his tail towards
the spring-board, until I remarked that a second man, placed in
the rear of the other, every now and then, slily passed his hand
under his neighbour&#8217;s arm to give the horse a small piece of
carrot.</span></p>

<p id="para_12">12. Astley may give us a useful hint in our far easier
task of dog-breaking. We see that he endeavoured by
kindness and patience to make the horse thoroughly
comprehend the meaning of certain words and signals
before he allowed him any companion. So ought you,
by what may be termed &#8220;initiatory lessons,&#8221; to make
your young dog perfectly understand the meaning of
certain words and signs, before you hunt him in the
company of another dog&mdash;nay, before you hunt him at
all; and, in pursuance of Astley&#8217;s plan, you ought to give
these lessons when you are alone with the dog, and his
attention is not likely to be withdrawn to other matters.
Give them, also, when he is fasting, as his faculties will
then be clearer, and he will be more eager to obtain any
rewards of biscuit or other food.</p>

<div class="pageheader">QUICK TRAINING.</div>

<p id="para_13">13. Be assured, that by a consistent adherence to the
simple rules which I will explain, you can obtain the
perfection I have described, &#40;<a href="#para_8">8</a>&#41; with more ease and expedition
than you probably imagine to be practicable;
and, if you will zealously follow my advice, I promise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that, instead of having to give up your shooting in
September, &#40;for I am supposing you to be in England&#41;
while you break in your pup, you shall then be able to
take him into the field, provided he is tolerably well-bred
and well disposed, perfectly obedient, and, except
that he will not have a well-confirmed, judicious range,
almost perfectly made; at least so far made, that he
will only commit such faults, as naturally arise from
want of experience. Let me remind you also, that the
keep of dogs is expensive, and supplies an argument
for making them earn their bread by hunting to a <i>useful</i>
purpose, as soon as they are of an age to work without
injury to their constitution. Time, moreover, is valuable
to us all, or most of us fancy it is. Surely, then, that
system of education is best which imparts the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
expeditiously the required degree of knowledge.</p>

<p id="para_14">14. It is seldom of any advantage to a dog to have
more than one instructor. The methods of teaching
may be the same; but there will be a difference in the
tone of voice and in the manner, that will more or less
puzzle the learner, and retard rather than advance his
education. If, therefore, you resolve to break in your
dog, do it entirely yourself: let no one interfere with you.</p>

<p id="para_15">15. As a general rule, let his education begin when
he is about six or seven months old,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> &#40;although I allow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that some dogs are more precocious than others, and
bitches always more forward than dogs,&#41; but it ought to
be nearly completed before he is shown a bird &#40;<a href="#para_132">132&#41;</a>.
A quarter of an hour&#8217;s daily in-door training&mdash;called
by the Germans &#8220;house-breaking&#8221;&mdash;for three or four
weeks will effect more than a month&#8217;s constant hunting
without preliminary tuition.</p>

<div class="pageheader">USE OF INITIATORY LESSONS.</div>

<p id="para_16">16. Never take your young dog out of doors for instruction,
until he has learned to know and obey the
several words of command which you intend to give
him in the field, and is well acquainted with all the
signs which you will have occasion to make to him
with your arms. These are what may be called the
initiatory lessons.</p>

<p id="para_17">17. Think a moment, and you will see the importance
of this preliminary instruction, though rarely imparted.
Why should it be imagined, that at the precise moment
when a young dog is enraptured with the first sniff of
game, he is, by some mysterious unaccountable instinct,
to understand the meaning of the word &#8220;Toho?&#8221; Why
should he not conceive it to be a word of encouragement
to rush in upon the game, as he probably longs to
do; especially if it should be a partridge fluttering
before him, in the sagacious endeavour to lure him
from her brood, or a hare enticingly cantering off from
under his nose? There are breakers who would correct
him for not intuitively comprehending and obeying the
&#8220;Toho,&#8221; roared out with stentorian lungs; though, it
is obvious, the youngster, from having had no previous
instruction, could have no better reason for
understanding its import, than the watch-dog chained
up in yonder farm-yard. Again he hears the word
&#8220;Toho&#8221;&mdash;again followed by another licking, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
perhaps by the long lecture, &#8220;&#8217;Ware springing
birds, will you?&#8221; The word &#8220;Toho&#8221; then begins to
assume a most awful character; he naturally connects
it with the finding of game, and not understanding a
syllable of the lecture, lest he should a third time hear
it, and get a third drubbing, he judges it most prudent,
&#40;unless he is a dog of very high courage&#41; when next
aware of the presence of birds, to come in to heel; and
thus he commences to be a blinker, thanks to the
sagacity and intelligence of his tutor. I do not speak
of all professional dog-breakers, far from it. Many are
fully sensible that comprehension of orders must necessarily
precede all but accidental obedience. I am only
thinking of some whom it has been my misfortune to
see, and who have many a time made my blood boil at
their brutal usage of a fine high-couraged young dog.
Men who had a strong arm and hard heart to punish,&mdash;but
no temper and no head to instruct.</p>

<div class="pageheader">DOG YOUR COMPANION.</div>

<p id="para_18">18. So long as you are a bachelor, you can make a
companion of your dog, without incurring the danger
of his being spoiled by your wife and children; &#40;the
more, by-the-bye, he is your own companion and no
other person&#8217;s the better&#41; and it is a fact, though you
may smile at the assertion, that all the initiatory lessons
can be, and can best be, inculcated in your own breakfast-room.</p>

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;LEAD.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;TOHO.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;ON.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_19">19. Follow Astley&#8217;s plan. Let no one be present to
distract the dog&#8217;s attention. Call him to you by the
whistle you propose always using in the field. Tie a
slight cord a few yards long to his collar. Throw him
a small piece of toast or meat, saying, at the time,
&#8220;Dead, dead.&#8221; Do this several times, chucking it into
different parts of the room, and let him eat what he
finds. Then throw a piece &#40;always as you do so saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
&#8220;Dead&#8221;&#41;, and the moment he gets close to it, check
him by jerking the cord, at the same time saying,
&#8220;Toho,&#8221; and lifting up your right arm almost perpendicularly.
By pressing on the cord with your foot,
you can restrain him as long as you please. Do not
let him take what you have thrown, until you give
him the encouraging word, &#8220;On,&#8221; accompanied by a
forward movement of the right arm and hand, somewhat
similar to the swing of an underhand bowler at cricket.</p>

<p id="para_20">20. Let all your commands be given in a low voice.
Consider that in the field, where you are anxious not to
alarm the birds unnecessarily, your words must reach
your dogs&#8217; ears more or less softened by distance, and,
if their influence depends on loudness, they will have
the least effect at the very moment when you wish
them to have the most. For the same reason, in the
initiatory lessons, be careful not to whistle loudly.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p id="para_21">21. After a few trials with the checkcord, you will
find yourself enabled, without touching it, and merely
by using the word &#8220;Toho,&#8221; to prevent his seizing the
toast &#40;or meat&#41;, until you say &#8220;On,&#8221; or give him the
forward signal. When he gets yet more perfect in his
lesson, raising your right arm only, without employing
your voice, will be sufficient, especially if you have
gradually accustomed him to hear you speak less and
less loudly. If he draw towards the bread before he
has obtained leave, jerk the cord, and <i>drag him back to
the spot from which he stirred</i>. He is not to quit it
until you order him, occupy yourself as you may.
Move about, and occasionally go from him, as far as
you can, before you give the command &#8220;On.&#8221; This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
will make him less unwilling hereafter to continue
steady at his point while you are taking a circuit to
head him, and so get wild birds between him and your
gun, &#40;<a href="#para_265">265</a>, <a href="#para_284">284</a>.&#41; The signal for his advancing, when
you are facing him, is the &#8220;beckon&#8221; &#40;see <a href="#para_37">37</a>&#41;.</p>

<p id="para_22">22. At odd times let him take the bread the moment
you throw it, that his eagerness to rush forward to seize
it may be continued, only to be instantly restrained at your command.</p>

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;DROP.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;DOWN CHARGE.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_23">23. Your <i>left</i> arm raised perpendicularly, in a similar
manner, should make the young dog lie down. Call out
&#8220;Drop,&#8221; when so holding up the left hand, and press
him down with the other until he assumes a crouching
position. If you study beauty of attitude, his fore-legs
ought to be extended, and his head rest between them.
Make him lie well down, occasionally walking round
and round him, gradually increasing the size of the
circle&mdash;your eyes on his. Do not let him raise himself
to a sitting posture. If you do, he will have the
greater inclination hereafter to move about: <i>especially
when you want to catch him, in order to chide or correct
him</i>. A halt is all you require for the &#8220;Toho,&#8221; and you
would prefer his standing to his point, rather than his
lying down,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> as you then would run less risk of losing
sight of him in cover, heather, or high turnips, &amp;c.
Setters, however, naturally crouch so much more than
Pointers, that you will often not be able to prevent their
&#8220;falling&#8221; when they are close to game. Indeed, I have
heard some sportsmen argue in favour of a dog&#8217;s dropping,
&#8220;that it rested him.&#8221; An advantage, in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
opinion, in no way commensurate with the inconvenience
that often attends the practice.</p>

<p id="para_24">24. If you are satisfied with teaching him in a
slovenly manner, you can employ your right arm both
for the &#8220;Toho&#8221; and &#8220;Drop;&#8221; but that is not quite correct,
for the former is a natural stop, &#40;being the pause
to determine exactly where the game is lying, preparatory
to rushing in to seize it,&#41; which you prolong
by art,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> whilst the other is wholly opposed to nature.
The one affords him great delight, especially when, from
experience, he has well learned its object: the latter is
always irksome. Nevertheless, it must be firmly established.
It is the triumph of your art. It insures
future obedience. But it cannot be effectually taught
without creating more or less awe, and it should create
awe. It is obvious, therefore, that it must be advantageous
to make a distinction between the two signals,&mdash;especially
with a timid dog,&mdash;for he will not then be
so likely to blink on seeing you raise your right hand,
when he is drawing upon game. Nevertheless, there
are breakers so unreasonable as not only to make that
one signal, but the one word &#8220;Drop&#8221; &#40;or rather &#8220;Down&#8221;&#41;
answer both for the order to point, and the order to
crouch! How can such tuition serve to enlarge a dog&#8217;s ideas?</p>

<div class="pageheader">USE OF CHECKCORD.</div>

<p id="para_25">25. To perfect him in the &#8220;Down,&#8221; that difficult part
of his education,&mdash;difficult, because it is unnatural,&mdash;practise
it in your walks. At very uncertain, unexpected
times catch his eye, &#40;having previously stealthily
taken hold of the checkcord&mdash;a long, light one,&#41; or
whistle to call his attention, and then hold up your left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
arm. If he does not <i>instantly</i> drop, jerk the checkcord
violently, and, as before, drag him back to the exact
spot where he should have crouched down. Admit of
no compromise. You must have <i>implicit, unhesitating,
instant</i>, obedience. When you quit him, he must not
be allowed to crawl <i>an inch</i> after you. If he attempt
it, drive a spike into the ground, and attach the end of
the checkcord to it, allowing the line to be slack; then
leave him quickly, and on his running after you he will
be brought up with a sudden jerk. So much the better:
it will slightly alarm him. As before, take him back to
the precise place he quitted,&mdash;do this invariably, though
he may have scarcely moved. There make him again
&#8220;Drop&#8221;&mdash;always observing to jerk the cord at the
moment you give the command. After a few trials of
this tethering, &#40;say less than a dozen&#41; he will be certain
to lie down steadily, until you give the proper order or
a signal &#40;<a href="#para_21">21</a>&#41;, let you run away, or do what you may to
excite him to move. One great advantage of frequently
repeating this lesson, and thus teaching it <i>thoroughly</i>, is,
that your dog will hereafter always feel, more or less, in
subjection, whenever the cord is fastened to his collar.
He must be brought to instantly obey the signal, even
at the extreme limit of his beat.</p>

<p id="para_26">26. Most probably he will not at first rise when he is
desired. There is no harm in that,&mdash;a due sense of the
inutility of non-compliance with the order to &#8220;Drop,&#8221;
and a wholesome dread of the attendant penalty, will
be advantageous. Go up to him,&mdash;pat him,&mdash;and lead
him for some paces, &#8220;making much of him,&#8221; as they say
in the cavalry. Dogs which are over-headstrong and
resolute, can only be brought under satisfactory command
by this lesson being indelibly implanted,&mdash;and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
think a master before he allows the keeper to take a
pup into the field to show him game, should insist upon
having ocular demonstration that he is perfect in the &#8220;Drop.&#8221;</p>

<div class="pageheader">PUPPIES AT PIGEON MATCH.</div>

<p id="para_27">27. When he is well confirmed in this all-important
lesson, obeying implicitly, yet cheerfully, you may,
whilst he is lying down, &#40;in order to teach him the
&#8220;down charge,&#8221;&#41; go through the motions of loading, on
no account permitting him to stir until you give him
the forward signal, or say &#8220;On.&#8221; After a few times you
may fire off a copper cap, and then a little powder, but
be very careful not to alarm him. Until your dog is
quite reconciled to the report of a gun, never take him
up to any one who may be firing. I have, however,
known of puppies being familiarized to the sound, by
being at first kept at a considerable distance from the
party firing, and then gradually, and by slow degrees
brought nearer. This can easily be managed at a rifle
or pigeon match, and the companionship of a made-dog
would much expedite matters. Whenever, in the lessons,
your young dog has behaved steadily and well,
give him a reward. Do not throw it to him; let him
take it from your hands. It will assist in making him
tender-mouthed, and in attaching him to you.</p>

<div class="pageheader">LESSONS AT FEEDING TIME.</div>

<p id="para_28">28. In some cavalry regiments in India, the feeding-time
is denoted by the firing off of a pistol. This soon
changes a young horse&#8217;s first dread of the report into
eager, joyous, expectation. You might, if you did not
dislike the trouble, in a similar manner, soon make your
pup regard the report of a gun as the gratifying summons
to his dinner, but coupled with the understanding
that, as a preliminary step, he is to crouch the instant
he hears the sound. After a little perseverance you
would so well succeed, that you would not be obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
even to raise your hand. If habituated to wait patiently
at the &#8220;drop,&#8221; however hungry he may be, before he is
permitted to taste his food, it is reasonable to think he
will remain at the &#8220;down charge,&#8221; yet more patiently
before he is allowed to &#8220;seek dead.&#8221;</p>

<p id="para_29">29. If your pupil be unusually timid, and you cannot
banish his alarm on hearing the gun, couple him to
another dog which has no such foolish fears, and will
steadily &#8220;down charge.&#8221; The confidence of the one, will
impart confidence to the other. Fear and joy are feelings
yet more contagious in animals than in man. It is
the visible, joyous animation of the old horses, that so
quickly reconciles the cavalry colt to the sound of the &#8220;feeding-pistol.&#8221;</p>

<p id="para_30">30. A keeper who had several dogs to break, would
find the advantage of pursuing the cavalry plan just
noticed. Indeed, he might extend it still further, by
having his principal in-door drill at feeding-time, and
by enforcing, but in minuter details, that kennel discipline
which has brought many a pack of hounds to
marvellous obedience.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He should place the food in
different parts of the yard. He should have a short
checkcord on all his pupils; and, after going slowly
through the motions of loading, &#40;the dogs having regularly
&#8220;down charged&#8221; on the report of the gun,&#41; he
should call each separately by name, and by signals of
the hand send them successively to different, but designated
feeding-troughs. He might then call a dog to
him, which had commenced eating, and, after a short
abstinence, make him go to another trough. He might
bring two to his heels and make them change troughs,
and so vary the lesson, that, in a short time, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
aid of the checkcords, he would have them under such
complete command, that they would afterwards give
him comparatively but little trouble in the field. As
they became more and more submissive, he would
gradually retire further and further, so as, at length, to
have his orders obeyed, when at a considerable distance
from his pupils. The small portion of time these lessons
would occupy, compared with their valuable results,
should warn him most forcibly not to neglect them.</p>

<p id="para_31"><span class="small">31. All keepers will acknowledge that, excepting a systematic
beat, there is nothing more difficult to teach a Pointer or Setter
than to refrain from &#8220;pursuing Hare.&#8221; They will concede that
there is a natural tendency in the breed to stand at game; and, as
a necessary consequence, they must admit that they would have
far more trouble in weaning a young fox-hound from the habit,
whose every instinct urges him to chase. And yet these keepers
may daily see not merely one hound, but a whole pack in the
highest condition, full of energy and spirits, drawing a cover alive
with Hares, not one of which a single dog will even look at.
Should not this fact convince a keeper, that if he is often obliged
to speak loudly to the brace of dogs <i>he calls</i> broken, there must be
something radically wrong in his management? Is he satisfied
that he began their education sufficiently early, and that he has
been uniformly consistent since its commencement?</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SHOOTING PONIES.</div>

<p id="para_32"><span class="small">32. If you have to break in a shooting pony, you must adopt
some such plan as that named in <a href="#para_27">27</a> and <a href="#para_28">28</a> to make him steady.
Your object will be never to alarm him, and gradually to render
him fond of the sound of the gun. To effect this, you will keep
the pistol, or whatever arms you use, for a long time out of his
sight. Commence by burning but little powder, and fire<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> at some
distance from him. Always give him a slice of carrot or apple
immediately after he hears the report, and, if you act judiciously
and patiently, he will soon love the sound. You may then fire in
his presence &#40;<i>turning your back upon him, as if he were not a party
in any way concerned</i>&#41;, and, by degrees, approach nearer and nearer;
but do not go quite into his stall,&mdash;that would make him shrink or
start, and you wish to banish all nervousness; the least precipitation
would undo you; therefore begin in the stable, with only using a
copper cap. Need I caution you against firing if near any straw?</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">RUSHING AT FENCES.</div>

<p id="para_33"><span class="small">33. Confidence being fully established, pursue the same plan
when you ride the pony. Again commence with a copper cap, only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
by slow degrees coming to the full charge. As before, always
reward him after every discharge, and also at the moment when you
pull up and throw the reins on his neck. If he finds he gets slices
of carrot when he stands stock-still, he will soon become so anxious
to be stationary that you will have to ride with spurs to keep him
to his work. By such means you could get him to lead over fences
and stand on the other side until you remount. Many years ago I
had in Ireland a chestnut which did not belie his colour, for I
purchased him far below his value on account of his great impetuosity
with hounds. He had a sad habit of rushing at his leaps,
but riding him in a smooth snaffle, and often giving him slices
of carrot, gradually cured his impatience, and he ultimately became
very gentle and pleasant. A naval officer, well known to a friend
of mine, finding he could not by other means make his pony stand
when the dogs pointed, used, sailor like, to anchor the animal by
&#8220;heaving overboard&#8221; &#40;as he expressed it&#41; a heavy weight to which
a line from the curb-bit was attached. The weight was carried in
one of the holster pipes,&mdash;in the other was invariably stowed away
a liberal allowance of &#8220;Grog and Prog.&#8221;</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;DEAD.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;SEEK.&#8221;&mdash;SIGNALS.</div>

<p id="para_34">34. When your young dog is tolerably well advanced
in the lessons which you have been advised to practise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hide a piece of bread or biscuit. Say &#8220;Dead, dead.&#8221;
Call him to you. &#40;<a href="#para_44">44</a>.&#41; Let him remain by you for
nearly a minute or two. Then say &#8220;Find,&#8221; or &#8220;Seek.&#8221;
Accompany him in his search. By your actions and
gestures make him fancy you are yourself looking about
for something, for dogs are observing, one might say,
imitative, creatures.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Stoop and move your right hand
to and fro near the ground. Contrive that he shall
come upon the bread, and reward him by permitting him
to eat it.</p>

<p id="para_35">35. After a little time &#40;a few days I mean&#41;, he will
show the greatest eagerness on your saying, at any unexpected
moment, &#8220;Dead.&#8221; He will connect the word
with the idea that there is something very desirable
concealed near him, and he will be all impatience to be
off and find it; <i>but make him first come to you</i>, &#40;for
reason, see <a href="#para_269">269</a>.&#41;&mdash;Keep him half a minute.&mdash;Then say
&#8220;Find,&#8221; and, without your accompanying him, he will
search for what you have previously hidden. Always
let him be encouraged to perseverance by discovering
something acceptable.</p>

<p id="para_36">36. Unseen by him, place the rewards &#40;one at a time&#41;,
in different parts of the room,&mdash;under the rug or carpet,
and more frequently on a chair, a table, or a low shelf.
He will be at a loss in what part of the room to search.
Assist him by a motion of your arm and hand. A
wave of the right arm and hand to the right, will soon
show him that he is to hunt to the right, as he will find
there. The corresponding wave of the left hand and
arm to the left, will explain to him, that he is to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a cast to the left. The underhand bowler&#8217;s swing of the
right hand and arm, will show that he is to hunt in a
forward direction.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Your occasionally throwing the
delicacy &#40;in the direction you wish him to take&#41;, whilst
waving your hand, will aid in making him comprehend
the signal. You may have noticed how well, by watching
the action of a boy&#8217;s arm, his little cur judges
towards what point to run for the expected stone.</p>

<p id="para_37">37. When the hidden object is near you, but between
you and the dog, make him come towards you to seek
for it, beckoning him with your right hand. When he
is at a distance at the &#8220;Drop,&#8221; if you are accustomed
to recompense him for good behaviour, you can employ
this signal to make him rise and run towards you for
his reward, &#40;and, according to my judgment, he should
always join you after the &#8220;down charge,&#8221; <a href="#para_271">271</a>&#41;. By
these means you will thus familiarise him with a very
useful signal; for that signal will cause him to approach
you in the field, when you have made a circuit to head
him at his point &#40;knowing that birds will then be lying
somewhere between you and him&#41;, and want him to
draw nearer to the birds and you, to show you exactly
where they are. This some may call a superfluous refinement,
but I hope <i>you</i> will consider it a very killing
accomplishment, and being easily taught, it were a pity
to neglect it. When a Setter is employed in cock-shooting,
the advantage of using this signal is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
apparent. While the dog is steadily pointing, it enables
the sportsman to look for a favourable opening, and,
when he has posted himself to his satisfaction, to sign
to the Setter &#40;or if out of sight tell him&#41;, to advance
and flush the bird: when, should the sportsman have
selected his position with judgment, he will generally
get a shot. I have seen this method very successfully
adopted in America, where the forests are usually so
dense that cocks are only found on the outskirts in the
underwood.</p>

<div class="pageheader">LOOKING FOR INSTRUCTIONS.</div>

<p id="para_38">38. After a little time he will regularly look to you
for directions. Encourage him to do so; it will make
him hereafter, when he is in the field, desirous of hunting
under your eye, and induce him to look to you, in a
similar manner, for instructions in what direction he is
to search for game. Observe how a child watches its
mother&#8217;s eye; so will a dog watch yours, when he becomes
interested in your movements, and finds that you
frequently notice him.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BECKON.&mdash;&#8220;CARE.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_39">39. Occasionally, when he approaches any of the
spots where the bread lies hidden, say &#8220;Care,&#8221; and
slightly raise your right hand. He will quickly consider
this word, or signal, as an intimation that he is
near the object of his search.</p>

<p id="para_40">40. Never deceive him in any of these words and
signs, and never disappoint him of the expected reward.
Praise and caress him for good conduct; rate him for
bad. Make it a rule throughout the whole course of
his education, out of doors as fully as within, to act
upon this system. You will find that caresses and substantial
rewards are far greater incentives to exertion
than any fears of punishment.</p>

<p id="para_41">41. Your pup having become a tolerable proficient in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
these lessons, you may beneficially extend them by
employing the word &#8220;Up,&#8221; as a command that he is to
sniff high in the air to find the hidden bread or meat,
lying, say on a shelf, or on the back of a sofa. He will,
comparatively speaking, be some time in acquiring a
knowledge of the meaning of the word, and many would
probably term it an over-refinement in canine education;
but I must own I think you will act judiciously, if you
teach it perfectly in the initiatory lessons; for the word
&#8220;Up,&#8221; if well understood, will frequently save your
putting on the puzzle-peg. For this you would be
obliged to employ, should your dog prove disobedient
and be acquiring the execrable habit of &#8220;raking&#8221; as it
is termed, instead of searching for the delicious effluvia
with his nose carried high in the air. Colonel Hawker
much recommends the puzzle-peg, but I confess I would
not fetter the dog by using it, unless compelled by his
hereditary propensity to hunt-foot.</p>

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;UP.&#8221; &mdash;NOSE CARRIED HIGH.</div>

<p id="para_42">42. Whenever birds can be sought for in the wind,
the dog should thus hunt the field &#40;and the higher he
carries his nose the better&#41;, for, independently of the
far greater chance of finding them, they will allow the
dog to come much nearer, than when he approaches
them by the foot: but of this more anon. &#40;<a href="#para_185">185</a>, <a href="#para_186">186</a>.&#41;</p>

<p id="para_43">43. Setters and Pointers naturally hunt with their
noses sufficiently close to the ground,&mdash;they want elevating
rather than depressing. Notwithstanding, you
will do well to show your pupil a few times out of doors,
how to work out a scent, by dragging a piece of bread
unperceived by him <i>down wind</i> through grass, and then
letting him &#8220;foot&#8221; it out. Try him for a few yards at
first; you can gradually increase the length of the drag.
You must not, however, practise this initiatory lesson
too frequently, lest you give him the wretched custom
of pottering.</p>

<p id="para_44">44. The word &#8220;Heel,&#8221; and a backward low wave of
the right hand and arm to the rear, &#40;the reverse of the
underhand cricket-bowler&#8217;s swing,&#41; will, after a few
times, bring the dog close behind you. Keep him there

The object of the order was to make him instantly give
up hunting, and come to your heels. This signal cannot
be substituted for the &#8220;beckon.&#8221; The one is an order
always obeyed with reluctance &#40;being a command to
leave off hunting&#41;, whereas the &#8220;beckon&#8221; is merely an
instruction in what direction to beat, and will be attended
to with delight. The signal &#8220;heel,&#8221; however,

say &#8220;Gone,&#8221; or &#8220;Away.&#8221; This he will, after some
trials, perceive to be an intimation that it is of no use
to continue hunting for it.</p>

<p id="para_46">46. You will greatly facilitate his acquiring the
meaning of the command &#8220;Fence,&#8221; or &#8220;Ware fence,&#8221;
if, from time to time, as he is quitting the room through
the open door or garden window, you restrain him by
calling out that word.</p>

terms, &#8220;Ware sheep,&#8221; &#8220;Ware chase,&#8221; and &#8220;Ware lark.&#8221;
The last expression to be used when he is wasting his
time upon the scent of anything but game&mdash;a fault best
cured by plenty of birds being killed to him. However,
the simple word &#8220;No,&#8221; omitting &#8220;Chase&#8221; or &#8220;Fence,&#8221;
might be substituted advantageously for &#8220;Ware.&#8221; All
you want him to do is to desist from a wrong action.
That sharp sound,&mdash;and when necessary it can be clearly
thundered out,&mdash;cannot be misunderstood.</p>

<div class="pageheader">ACCUSTOMED TO COUPLES.</div>

<p id="para_48">48. That your young dog may not hereafter resist the
couples, yoke him occasionally to a stronger dog, and
for the sake of peace, and in the name of all that is
gallant, let it be to the one of the other sex who appears
to be the greatest favourite.</p>

<p id="para_49">49. When he is thus far advanced in his education,
and tolerably obedient, which he will soon become if
you are consistent, and <i>patient, yet strict</i>, you can, in
further pursuance of Astley&#8217;s plan, associate him in his
lessons with a companion. Should you be breaking
in another youngster, &#40;though one at a time you will
probably find quite enough, especially if it be your
laudable wish to give him hereafter a well-confirmed
scientific range,&#41; they can now be brought together for
instruction. You must expect to witness the same
jealousy which they would exhibit on the stubble.
Both will be anxious to hunt for the bread, and in
restraining them alternately from so doing, you exact
the obedience which you will require hereafter in the
field, when in their natural eagerness they will endeavour,
unless you properly control them, to take the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
point of birds from one another; or, in their rivalry,
run over the taint of a wounded bird, instead of collectedly
and perseveringly working out the scent. You
can throw a bit of toast and make them &#8220;Toho&#8221; it, and
then let the dog you name take it. In the same way
you can let each alternately search for a hidden piece,
after both have come up to you, on your saying &#8220;Dead.&#8221;
I would also advise you to accustom each dog to &#8220;drop,&#8221;
without any command from you, the moment he sees
that the other is down.</p>

<p id="para_50">50. Those lessons will almost ensure their hereafter
instantly obeying, and nearly instantly comprehending
the object of the signal to &#8220;back&#8221; any dog which may
be pointing game.</p>

<p id="para_51">51. When you take out two youngsters for exercise,
while they are romping about, suddenly call one into
&#8220;heel.&#8221; After a time again send him off on his gambols.
Whistle to catch the eye of the other, and signal to him
to join you. By working them thus alternately, while
they are fresh and full of spirits, you will habituate
them to implicit obedience. When the birds are wild,
and you are anxious to send a basket of game to a
friend, it is very satisfactory to be able merely by a
sign, without uttering a word, to bring the other dogs
into &#8220;heel,&#8221; leaving the ground to the careful favourite.
Teach the present lesson well, and you go far towards
attaining the desired result.</p>

<p id="para_52">52. I trust you will not object to the minuti&aelig; of these
initiatory lessons, and fancy you have not time to attend
to them. By teaching them well, you will gain time,&mdash;much
time,&mdash;and the time that is of most value to you
as a sportsman; for when your dog is regularly hunting
to your gun, his every faculty ought to be solely devoted
to finding birds, and his undisturbed intellects exclusively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
given to aid you in bagging them, instead of
being bewildered by an endeavour to comprehend novel
signals or words of command. I put it to you as a
sportsman, whether he will not have the more delight
and ardour in hunting, the more he feels that he understands
your instructions? and, further, I ask you,
whether he will not be the more sensitively alive to
the faintest indication of a haunt, and more readily
follow it up to a sure find, if he be unembarrassed by any
anxiety to make out what you mean, and be in no way
alarmed at the consequences of not almost instinctively
understanding your wishes?</p>

</div>

<div class="pageheader">CHECKCORD DESCRIBED.</div>

<p id="para_53">53. In all these lessons, and those which follow in
the field, the checkcord will wonderfully assist you.
Indeed, it may be regarded as the instructor&#8217;s right
hand. It can be employed so mildly as not to intimidate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the most gentle, and it can, without the aid of
any whip, be used with such severity, or, I should rather
say, perseverance, as to conquer the most wild and
headstrong, and these are sure to be dogs of the greatest
travel and endurance. The cord may be from ten to
twenty-five<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> yards long, according to the animal&#8217;s disposition,
and may be gradually shortened as he gets
more and more under command. Even when it is first
employed you can put on a shorter cord, if you perceive
that he is becoming tired. In thick stubble, especially
if cut with a sickle, the drag will be greater, far greater
than when the cord glides over heather. The cord may
be of the thickness of what some call strong lay-cord,
but made of twelve threads. Sailors would know it by
the name of log-line or cod-line. To save the end from
fraying it can be whipped with thread, which is better
than tying a knot because it is thus less likely to become
entangled.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SPANIELS BROKEN IN.</div>

<p id="para_54">54. Hunted with such a cord, the most indomitable
dog, when he is <i>perfectly obedient to the</i> &#8220;<i>drop</i>,&#8221; is nearly
as amenable to command, as if the end of the line were
in the breaker&#8217;s hand. By no other means can</p>

<p class="center">
SPANIELS
</p>

<p class="noindent">be <i>quickly</i> broken in. The general object of the trainer
is to restrain them from ranging at a distance likely to
spring game out of gun-shot, and to make them perfect
to the &#8220;down charge.&#8221; If one of these high-spirited
animals will not range close when called to by whistle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
or name, the breaker gets hold of the cord and jerks it;
this makes the dog come in a few paces; another jerk
or two makes him approach closer, and then the breaker,
by himself retiring with his face towards the spaniel,
calling out his name &#40;or whistling&#41;, and occasionally
jerking the cord, makes him quite submissive, and more
disposed to obey on future occasions.</p>

<p id="para_55">55. In training a large team it is of much advantage
to the keeper to have a lad to rate, and, when necessary,
give the skirters a taste of the lash, in short, to act
as whipper-in. The keeper need not then carry a whip,
or at least often use it, which will make his spaniels all
the more willing to hunt close to him.</p>

<div class="pageheader">FOUR-LEGGED WHIPPER-IN.</div>

<p id="para_56">56. Lord <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;r&#8217;s</span> head gamekeeper was singularly
aided:&mdash;he possessed a four-legged whipper-in. A few
years ago while Mr. <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;s</span> &#40;M.P. for a South Eastern
County&#41; was with a shooting party at his Lordship&#8217;s,
the keeper brought into the field a brace of powerful
retrievers, and a team of spaniels, among which were
two that had never been shot over. On the first pheasant
being killed, all the old spaniels dropped to shot,
but one of the young ones rushed forward and mouthed
the bird. The person who had fired ran on to save it,
but the keeper called aloud, and requested him not
to move. The man then made a signal to one of the
retrievers to go. He did so instantly, but, instead of
meddling with the bird, he seized the spaniel, lifted him
up, and shook him well. The moment the pup could
escape, he came howling to the &#8220;heels&#8221; of the keeper,
and lay down among his companions. The keeper then
confessed that a couple of the spaniels had never been
shot to,&mdash;but he confidently assured the sportsmen, they
would see before the day was over, that the pups behaved
fully as steadily as the old dogs, and explained to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
party, how the retriever did all the disagreeable work,
and indeed, nearly relieved him of every trouble in
breaking in the youngsters. On the next few shots this
novel schoolmaster was again deputed to show his pupils
that he would not allow his special duties as a retriever
to be interfered with. Both the young dogs, having
been thus well chastised, became more careful,&mdash;made
only partial rushes to the front, when a recollection of
their punishment, and a dread of their four-footed tutor
brought them slinking back to their older companions.
As the keeper had averred, they soon learned their
lesson completely,&mdash;gave up all thoughts of chasing
after shot, and quietly crouched down with the other
dogs.</p>

<div class="pageheader">RETRIEVER MADE BREAKER.</div>

<p id="para_57">57. I can easily imagine that it was a feeling of
jealousy, which first prompted the retriever to thrash
some spaniel who was endeavouring to carry off a bird,
and that the clever keeper encouraged him in doing so,
instantly perceiving the value of such assistance. It is
worth a consideration whether it would not be advisable
to train the retriever employed with a team to give this
assistance. A dog of a quarrelsome disposition could be
taught, by your urging him, to seize any spaniel who
might be mouthing a bird, in the same manner you
would set on a young terrier to fly at a rat.</p>

<p id="para_58">58. Doubtless it is the <i>highest</i> training to teach a
team to &#8220;down charge,&#8221; but most breakers make their
spaniels come into &#8220;heel,&#8221; or rather gather close around
them, &#40;by the word &#8220;round&#8221;&#41; whenever a gun is discharged.
This plan, though so injudicious in the case
of pointers or setters, is but little objectionable in the
case of spaniels, for spaniels in their small sweep inwards,
are not likely to spring game while the guns are
unloaded. It certainly possesses this merit, that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
readily taught to puppies, &#40;with the aid of a whipper-in&#41;
by the trainer&#8217;s giving them some delicacy on their
rejoining him. It may be urged, too, that the method
much removes any necessity for noise in calling to a
dog,&mdash;whereas, with a team trained to the &#8220;down charge,&#8221;
however highly broken, it will occasionally
happen that the keeper &#40;or assistant&#41; has to rate some
excited skirter for not instantly &#8220;dropping.&#8221; Moreover,
in thick cover an infraction of the irksome rule to
&#8220;down charge&#8221; may sometimes escape detection, which
might lead to future acts of insubordination. The
lamented Prince Albert&#8217;s team of Clumbers &#8220;down charge,&#8221;
but the greatest attention could be given, and
was given to them. They were admirably broken, and
I might add, were shot over by a first-rate hand.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SPANIELS BROKEN IN.</div>

<p id="para_59">59. When exercising young spaniels it is a good plan
to habituate them, even as puppies, never to stray
further from you than about twenty yards. With them,
even more than with other kinds of dogs trained for the
gun, great pains should be taken to prevent their having
the opportunity of &#8220;self-hunting.&#8221; If it is wished to
break from hare, the method to be followed is mentioned
in <a href="#para_334">334</a>, &amp;c., for with spaniels as with setters &#40;or pointers&#41;
it is always advisable to drag them back to the spot
from which they started in pursuit.</p>

<p id="para_60">60. Occasionally you may see a country blacksmith,
when preparing to shoe the hind-legs of a cart-horse
that appears disposed to make a disagreeable use of his
heels, twist the long hair at the end of his tail,&mdash;raise
the foot that is to be shod,&mdash;pass the twisted hair round
the leg immediately above the hock, and by these means
press the tendon close to the bone. The tail assists in
retaining the leg in position, and thus for the time the
limb is rendered powerless. Acting much upon this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
coercive principle, but discarding the aid of the tail,
some breakers <i>slightly</i> confine a hind-leg of their most
unruly spaniels with a soft bandage, shifting it from one
leg to the other about every hour. Possibly a loop of
vulcanized india-rubber, being elastic, would best answer
the purpose. Restrained in this manner a dog is less
likely to tumble about, and become injured, than if one
of his fore-legs had been passed through his collar.
Other breakers when hunting many couples together,
fasten a belt with a few pounds of shot round the necks
of the wildest. But the sooner such adjuncts to discipline
can be safely discarded the better; for &#8220;brushing&#8221;
a close cover is severe work. Gorse is the most trying.
Its prickles are so numerous and fine, that the ears and
eyes of every spaniel hunted in it ought to be separately
examined on returning home, and well bathed in warm
water. Their eyes are peculiarly liable to be injured by
dust and gravel from their hunting so close to the ground.</p>

<div class="pageheader">HUNTED IN GORSE.</div>

<p id="para_61">61. To give young spaniels sufficient courage to face
the most entangled cover, a judicious trainer will occasionally
introduce them to thick brakes, or gorse, early
in the morning, or in the evening, when the noise of his
approach will have made the pheasants feeding in the
neighbourhood, run far into it for shelter. The effluvia
of the birds will then so excite the young dogs, especially
if cheered with good companionship, &#40;which always
creates emulation,&#41; that they will utterly disregard the
pricks and scratches of the strongest furze.</p>

<p id="para_62">62. If the time of year will permit it, they should be
shown game when about nine or ten months old. At a
more advanced age they would be less amenable to control.
Happily the example of a riotous pup will not be
so detrimental to the discipline of the rest of the team,
as the example of an ill-conducted companion would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to a pointer &#40;or setter&#41;, for the influence of thoroughly
steady spaniels makes the pup curtail his range sooner
than might be expected. Finding that he is not followed
by his associates he soon rejoins them.</p>

<p id="para_63">63. A judicious breaker will regard perfection in the
&#8220;drop&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_23">23</a> to <a href="#para_26">26</a>&#41; as the main-spring of his educational
system. He will teach his young spaniels to &#8220;seek
dead,&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_34">34</a>, <a href="#para_35">35</a>, <a href="#para_43">43</a>&#41; where directed by signs of the hand.
He will instruct them in &#8220;fetching,&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_109">109</a>, <a href="#para_107">107</a>, &amp;c.&#41;
with the view to some of them hereafter retrieving. He
will accustom them to hunt hedge-rows, and light open
copses,&mdash;because always under his eye,&mdash;before taking
them into closer cover. Nor until they are under some
command, and well weaned from noticing vermin and
small birds, will he allow them to enter gorse or strong
thickets,&mdash;and then he will never neglect &#40;though probably
he will have used them before&#41; to attach bells of
<i>different sounds</i> to the collars of his several pupils &#40;one
to each&#41;, so that his ear may at all times detect any
truant straying beyond bounds, and thus enable him to
rate the delinquent by name. In this manner, he
establishes the useful feeling elsewhere spoken of &#40;<a href="#para_383">383</a>&#41;,
that whether he be within or out of sight, he is equally
aware of every impropriety that is committed.</p>

<p id="para_64">64. Young spaniels, when they have been steadily
broken in not to hunt too far ahead on the instructor&#8217;s
side of the hedge, may be permitted to beat on the
other;&mdash;and this when only one person is shooting, is
generally their most useful position, for they are thus
more likely to drive the game towards the gun.</p>

<p id="para_65">65. If a keeper is hunting the team, while you and a
friend are beating narrow belts or strips of wood,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
you and he be placed, as is usual, on the outside, a little
ahead of the keeper &#40;one to his right, the other to his
left&#41;, you would much aid him in preventing the young
spaniels from ranging wildly, were you to turn your
face towards him whenever you saw any of them getting
too far in advance, for they will watch the guns as much
as they will him. They should never range further than
thirty yards from the gun.</p>

<div class="pageheader">EXPERIENCED SPANIELS.</div>

<p id="para_66">66. Among spaniels the great advantage of age and
experience is more apparent than in partridge-dogs. A
young spaniel cannot keep to a pheasant&#8217;s tail like an
old one. He may push the bird for forty or fifty yards
if judiciously managed. After that he is almost sure
from impatience, either to lose it, or rush in and flush
out of shot, whereas an old cocker, who has had much
game shot over him, is frequently knowing enough to
slacken his pace, instead of increasing it, when he first
touches on birds, apparently quite sensible that he ought
to give the gun time to approach, before he presses to a
flush.</p>

<div class="pageheader">DIFFICULT TO BREAK.</div>

<p id="para_67">67. Even good spaniels, however well-bred, if they
have not had great experience, generally road too fast.
Undeniably they are difficult animals to educate, and it
requires much watchfulness, perseverance, and attention
at an early age, so to break in a team of young ones
that they shall keep within gun range, without your
being compelled to halloo or whistle to them. But
some few are yet more highly trained.</p>

<p id="para_68">68. Mr. <span class="glue">N&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, when in France, had a lively, intelligent,
liver and white cocker, which would work
busily all day long within gun-shot; and which possessed
the singular accomplishment of steadily pointing
all game that lay well, and of not rushing in until the
sportsman had come close to him. But this is a case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
high breaking more curious than useful, for spaniels are
essentially <i>springers</i>, not <i>pointers</i>, and the little animal
must frequently have been lost sight of in cover. The
Messrs. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, alluded to in <a href="#para_551">551</a>, had also a cocker
that regularly pointed. Our grandfathers used to apply
the term springers solely to large spaniels,&mdash;never to the
Duke of Marlborough&#8217;s small breed, which was greatly
prized.</p>

<div class="pageheader">TRUE NOSES.&mdash;COVER SHOOTING.</div>

<p id="para_69">69. A dog is generally most attached to that description
of sport, and soonest recognises the scent of that
game, to which he has principally been accustomed in
youth. He will through life hunt most diligently where
he first had the delight of often finding. The utility
therefore is obvious of introducing spaniels at an early
age to close covers and hedge-rows, and setters and
pointers to heather and stubble.</p>

<p id="para_70">70. In spaniels, feathered sterns and long ears are
much admired, but obviously the latter must suffer in
thick underwood. The chief requisite in all kinds of
spaniels, is, that they be good finders, and have noses so
true that they will never overrun a scent. Should they
do so when footing an old cock-pheasant, the chances
are, that he will double back on the exact line by which
he came. They should be high-mettled,&mdash;as regardless
of the severest weather as of the most punishing cover,
and ever ready to spring into the closest thicket the
moment a pointed finger gives the command.</p>

<p id="para_71">71. A comprehension of the signal made by the
finger, &#40;which is far neater than the raising of the hand
described in <a href="#para_34">34</a>, but not so quickly understood&#41; might
with advantage be imparted to all dogs trained for the
gun, in order to make them hunt close <i>exactly</i> where
directed. It is usually taught by pointing with the fore-finger
of the right hand to pieces of biscuit, previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
concealed, near easily recognised tufts of grass, weeds,
&amp;c. It is beautiful to see how correctly, promptly, yet
quietly, some spaniels will work in every direction thus
indicated.</p>

<div class="pageheader">COVER SHOOTING.</div>

<p id="para_72">72. Breasting a strong cover with cockers, is more
suited to young, than to old men. The gun must follow
rapidly, and stick close when a dog is on the road of
feather. A shot will then infallibly be obtained, if a
good dog be at work; for the more closely a bird is
pressed, the hotter gets the scent. If a pheasant found
in thick cover on marshy ground near water,&mdash;a locality
they much like in hot weather,&mdash;is not closely pushed,
he will so twist, and turn, and double upon old tracks,
that none but the most experienced dogs will be able to
stick to him.</p>

<p id="para_73">73. The preceding observations respecting spaniels
apply to all descriptions employed on land-service,
whether of the strong kind, the Sussex breed and the
Clumber, or the smallest cockers, Blenheims and King
Charles&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But whether they are to be trained not to
hunt flick,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> &#40;the most difficult part of their tuition, and
in which there is generally most failure&#41;, and whether
they shall be bred to give tongue, or run mute, will
depend much upon the nature of the country to be
hunted, and yet more upon the taste of the proprietor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
No fixed rules can be given for a sport that varies so
much as cover shooting.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BELLS IN COVER.</div>

<p id="para_74">74. Of the large kind, most sportsmen will think a
couple and a half a sufficient number to hunt at a time.
Certainly one of them should retrieve: and they ought
to be well broken in not to notice flick. These dogs are
most esteemed when they run mute. If they do, they
must be hunted with bells in very thick cover; but the
less bells are employed the better, for the tinkling sound,
in a greater or smaller degree, annoys all game. Such
dogs, when good, are very valuable.</p>

<p id="para_75"><span class="small">75. I once shot over a team of Clumber spaniels belonging to
Mr. <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;z</span>. The breed &#40;the Duke of Newcastle&#8217;s, taking their
name from one of his seats&#41;, are mostly white with a little lemon
colour, have large sensible heads, thick, short legs, silky coats, carry
their sterns low, and hunt perfectly mute. The team kept within
twenty or twenty-five yards of the keeper, were trained to acknowledge
Rabbits, as well as all kinds of game; and in the country
Mr. <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;z</span> was then shooting over afforded capital sport. One of
the spaniels was taught to retrieve. He would follow to any distance,
and seldom failed to bring. A regular retriever was, however,
generally taken out with them. Mr. <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;z</span> told me that they
required very judicious management, and encouragement rather
than severity, as undue whipping soon made them timid. They
are of a delicate constitution. He rather surprised me by saying
that his spaniels from working quietly and ranging close, &#40;therefore,
alarming the birds less,&#41; procured him far more shots in turnips
than his pointers; and he had three that looked of the right sort.
He explained matters, however, by telling me, that it was his
practice to make a circuit round the outskirts of a turnip or potato
field before hunting the inner parts. This of course greatly tended
to prevent the birds breaking &#40;<a href="#para_401">401</a>&#41;. A juvenile sportsman would
rejoice in the services of the spaniels, for many a rabbit would they
procure for him without the aid of powder and shot.</span></p>

</div>

<p id="para_76"><span class="small">76. When Colonel <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who died in Syria, was stationed with
his troop of Horse Artillery at Pontefract, he was asked to shoot
partridges at Lord <span class="glue">P&mdash;&mdash;n&#8217;s</span> seat in Yorkshire. On meeting the
gamekeeper, according to appointment, he found him surrounded
by a team of Clumber spaniels. Colonel <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>, in some surprise
at seeing no setters or pointers, remarked that he had expected
some <i>partridge</i> shooting. &#8220;I know it,&#8221; answered the man, &#8220;and
I hope to show you some sport.&#8221; To the inquiry why one of the
spaniels was muzzled, the keeper said that his master had threatened
to shoot it should it again give tongue, and, as it possessed a particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fine nose, he &#40;the keeper&#41; was anxious not to lose it.
They walked on, and soon the man told <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> to be prepared, as
the spaniels were feathering. A covey rose. The Colonel, who was
a good shot, killed right and left. All the Clumbers dropped
instantly. When he was reloading, the keeper begged him to say
which of the dogs should retrieve the game. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> pointed to
a broad-headed dog lying in the middle, when the keeper directed
by name the spaniel so favoured to be off. It quickly fetched one
of the birds. The keeper then asked <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> to choose some other
dog to bring the remaining bird&mdash;a runner. He did so, and the
animal he selected to act as retriever, performed the duty very
cleverly; the rest of the team remaining quite still, until its
return.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">The Colonel had capital sport, killing nearly twenty brace, and
the dogs behaved beautifully throughout the day. When afterwards
relating the circumstances, he observed that, although an old sportsman,
he had seldom been so gratified, as it was a novel scene to
him, who had not been accustomed to shoot over spaniels.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">TEAM OF COCKERS.</div>

<p id="para_77">77. Of small cockers, three couples appear ample to
form a team. Some teams of small springers greatly
exceed this number, and many sportsmen shoot over
more than a couple and a half of the larger spaniels;
but it is a question whether, in the generality of cases,
the gun would not benefit by the number being diminished
rather than increased. The smaller in number
the team, the greater is the necessity that none of them
should stick too close to &#8220;heel.&#8221; The difficulty is to
make them hunt far enough, and yet not too far. At
least one of the number should retrieve well. If they
give tongue, it ought to be in an intelligible manner;
softly, when they first come on the haunt of a cock, but
making the cover ring again with their joyous melody,
when once the bird is flushed. A first-rate cocker will
never deceive by opening upon an old haunt, nor yet
find the gun unprepared by delaying to give due warning
before he flushes the bird. When cocks are abundant,
some teams are broken, not only to avoid flick, but
actually not to notice a pheasant, or anything beside
woodcock. Hardly any price would tempt a real lover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of cock-shooting, in a cocking country, to part with such
a team. Hawker terms the sport, &#8220;the fox-hunting of
shooting.&#8221; Some sportsmen kill water-hens to young
spaniels to practise them in forcing their way through
entangled covers, and get them well in hand and steady
against the all-important cocking season.</p>

<div class="pageheader">STRENGTH OF TEAM.</div>

<p id="para_78">78. When a regular retriever can be constantly employed
with spaniels, of course it will be unnecessary to
make any of them fetch game, &#40;certainly never to lift
anything which falls out of bounds&#41;, though all the
team should be taught to &#8220;seek dead.&#8221; This is the plan
pursued by the Duke of Newcastle&#8217;s keepers, and obviously
it is the soundest and easiest practice, for it
must always be more or less difficult to make a spaniel
keep within his usual hunting limits, who is occasionally
encouraged to pursue wounded game, at his best pace, to
a considerable distance.</p>

<p id="para_79">79. Other teams are broken no more than to keep
within range, being allowed to hunt all kinds of game,
and also rabbits; they, however, are restricted from
pursuing wounded flick further than fifty or sixty yards.
Where rabbits are abundant, and outlying, a team thus
broken affords lively sport,&mdash;nothing escapes them.</p>

<p id="para_80"><span class="small">80. In the large woods that traverse parts of Kent and Sussex,
a kind of hunting-shooting is followed, that affords more fun, where
there are plenty of rabbits and but few burrows, than might at first
be imagined. The dogs employed are the smallest beagles that can
be obtained. The little creatures stick to a hare, rabbit, or wounded
pheasant with greater pertinacity than most spaniels, probably
because they &#40;the beagles&#41; are slower, and hunt so low. Three or
four couples make most animating music in the woodlands, and
procure many shots, but they awfully disturb game. Mr. <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;z</span>
has gorse covers through which openings or rides are cut. He shoots
rabbits in them to a team of beagles trained not to notice hare.
The burrows are ferreted the preceding day, and regularly stopped.
The sport is excellent and most animating. Plenty of snap shots.
An old buck rabbit once or twice hunted becomes extremely cunning.
He is soon on the move, and will work round beyond the
dogs, so as to double back upon the ground already hunted.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">HUNTING-SHOOTING.</div>

<p id="para_81">81. Wild spaniels, though they may show you most
cock, will get you fewest shots, unless you have well-placed
markers. There are sportsmen who like to take
out one steady dog to range close to them, and a couple
of wild ones to hunt on the flanks, one on each side,
expressly that the latter may put up birds for the
markers to take note of.</p>

<p id="para_82"><span class="small">82. Mr. <span class="glue">O&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, who is devoted to shooting, acts upon this system,
but upon a more enlarged scale. Having previously posted his
markers, he has each cover, immediately before he shoots it, well
hunted by the wildest of the dogs: he then takes a steady animal
to the several spots pointed out, and is thus enabled to kill annually
thrice as many cock as any other man in the country. The aptness
of this bird, when a second time flushed, to return &#40;<a href="#para_397">397</a>&#41; to its old
haunt, and when again put up to take wing in the direction of its
first flight, much tends to its destruction.</span></p>

<p id="para_83">83. An old sportsman knows <i>mute</i> spaniels to be
most killing; a young one may prefer those which
give tongue, &#40;if true from the beginning owning nothing
but game,&#41; because, though undeniably greater disturbers
of a cover, they are more cheerful and animating. The
superiority of the former is, however, apparent on a
still calm day, when the least noise will make the game
steal away long before the gun gets within shot. But it
is not so in all countries.</p>

<p id="para_84"><span class="small">84. Wild as is the woodcock with us after it has recovered from
its fatiguing migratory flight, and been a few times disturbed, there
is not, perhaps, naturally, so tame a game-bird, and one more
difficult to flush in close cover where rarely alarmed. Officers
quartered at Corfu frequently cross in the morning to the Albanian
coast,&mdash;a two hours&#8217; sail or pull,&mdash;and return the same evening,
having bagged from fifty to sixty couples to half-a-dozen good guns.
Their boat is directed to meet them at some head-land, towards
which they shoot. An attendant to carry the game, and a relay of
ammunition, &amp;c., is told off to each sportsman, and <i>he</i> of the party
who best knows the country, is chosen captain for the day, and
walks in the centre of the line, the rest conforming to his movements.
There is generally an agreement to halt for a minute, but
not a second more, to allow a man to look for any cock he may have
knocked over; therefore the possessor of a first-rate retriever is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
envied character. The strength and density of the bush occasionally
there encountered, is more than we in England can imagine:
and in such situations, experience has shown the sportsmen the
superiority of spaniels which give tongue. On hearing the warning
cheerful music, the line halts for a few seconds, as, notwithstanding
all the noise, some little time may pass before the cock is sprung,
for he is frequently so protected by a wall of impervious thicket,
&#40;though sure to have a clear opening overhead for unimpeded flight&#41;
that the keenest dogs cannot immediately get at him.</span></p>

<p id="para_85"><span class="small">85. Although the country abounds with deer and boar, it is almost
needless to observe, that the cock-shooters are too noisy a party often
to bag such noble game, unless some ambitious and bold man &#40;for
being alone he risks having a long barrel covertly pointed at him&#41;
take up a favourable position far in advance. Captain Best, a
fellow-student of mine, about a dozen years ago, gives a spirited
account of this shooting, in his entertaining book, entitled &#8220;Excursions
in Albania.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_86"><span class="small">86. In the northern part of the Morea, about twenty-five miles
from Patras &#40;near Ali Tchelepi, a dilapidated monastery inhabited
by only three monks&mdash;near Monolada, and Pera Metochi&#41;, Mr.
<span class="glue">O&mdash;&mdash;n</span> and Captain <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;y</span>, between the 14th of January, 1843,
and the 11th of the following month &#40;both days inclusive&#41;, killed
862 woodcocks, 11 hares, 11 duck, and 11 snipe. Not bad sport!</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">COVERS.</div>

<p id="para_87">87. In very thick covers it is obvious, the height of
setters being greatly against them, that spaniels are far
preferable: but in light covers, and when the leaves are
off the trees, <i>handy</i> old setters &#40;if white, all the better&#41;
that will readily confine themselves to a restricted range,
and will flush their game when ordered &#40;<span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_IV">iv</a>.</span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_VII">vii</a>.</span> of
141 and <a href="#para_284">284</a>&#41; afford quite as much sport, if not more.
Setters do not, to the same degree, alarm birds; and
there is, also, this advantage, that they can be employed
on <i>all</i> occasions, excepting in low gorse or the closest
thickets, whereas spaniels, from their contracted &#8220;beat,&#8221;
are nearly useless in the open when game is scarce.
You will be prepared, when first you hunt a setter in
cover, to sacrifice much of your sport. There must be
noise; for it is essential to make him at once thoroughly
understand the very different &#8220;beat&#8221; required of him,
and this can only be effected by constantly checking
and rating him, whenever he ranges beyond the prescribed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
limits. He should hunt slowly and carefully to the
right and left, and never be much in advance of the
guns. In a short time he will comprehend matters, if
you are so forbearing and judicious as invariably to call
him away from every point made the least out of bounds.
A less severe test of your consistency will not suffice.
The few first days will either make or mar him as a
cover-dog. You must naturally expect that hunting
him much in cover, will injure his range in the open,
and make him too fond of hedge-rows.</p>

<p id="para_88"><span class="small">88. But there is a man in Yorkshire, who will not willingly admit
this. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, Sir George <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;e&#8217;s</span> gamekeeper,&mdash;and a good one
he is,&mdash;for he has a particularly difficult country to protect, one
intersected with &#8220;rights of way&#8221; in every direction,&mdash;makes his
pointers as freely hunt the cover as the open. You never lose them,
for they are sure to make their appearance when they think they
have given you ample time to go to them if you choose. This cover
work does not the least unsteady them, but it is right to state, that
<span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>is an unusually good breaker, and works his dogs with
singular temper and patience. They are very attached to him, and
appear to listen anxiously to what he says when he talks to them,&mdash;which,
I own, he does more than I recommend.</span></p>

<p id="para_89">89. Pointers, however, are manifestly out of place in strong cover,
though an unusually high-couraged one may occasionally be found,
who will dash forward in defiance of pricks and scratches; but it is
not fair to expect it. In a very light cover I have often shot over
one belonging to a relation of mine, which was so clever, that when
I came close to her as she was pointing, she would frequently run
round to the other side of the thicket, and then rush in to drive the
game towards me. This killing plan had in no way been taught
her; she adopted it solely of her own sagacity. Having been much
hunted in cover when young, she was so fond of it &#40;<a href="#para_69">69</a>&#41; as to be,
comparatively speaking, quite unserviceable on the stubbles.</p>

<div class="pageheader">WATER SPANIELS.</div>

<p class="center">WATER SPANIELS, &#40;<span class="smcap">or Water Retrievers</span>.&#41;</p>

<p id="para_90">90. A young water spaniel might, with advantage,
occasionally be indulged with a duck-hunt in warm
weather. It would tend to make him quick in the
water, and observant. The finishing lessons might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
conclude with your shooting the bird and obliging him
to retrieve it. He should be made handy to your signals
&#40;<span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_IV">iv</a>.</span> to <span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_VII">vii</a>.</span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_X">x</a>.</span> of 141&#41;, so as to hunt the fens
and marshes, and &#8220;seek dead&#8221; exactly where you may
wish.</p>

<p id="para_91">91. This obedience to the hand is particularly required;
for when the spaniel is swimming he is on a
level with the bird, and therefore is not so likely to see
it,&mdash;especially if there is a ripple on the water,&mdash;as
you are, who probably may be standing many feet above
him on the shore. As you may frequently, while he is
retrieving, have occasion to direct his movements when
at a considerable distance from him, you probably
would find it more advantageous to teach him the forward
signal used by shepherds &#40;<a href="#para_143">143</a>&#41;, than the one
described in <span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_IV">iv</a>.</span> of 141.</p>

<p id="para_92">92. A water spaniel should also be taught to fetch
&#40;<a href="#para_96">96</a>, <a href="#para_98">98</a>, <a href="#para_106">106</a> to <a href="#para_109">109</a>&#41;,&mdash;be accustomed to follow quietly

you signal to him, while you are noiselessly stalking
the wild-fowl previously reconnoitered, with the aid of
your Dollond, from some neighbouring height; nor
should he stir a limb, however long he and you may
have to await, ensconced behind a favouring bush, the
right moment for the destructive raking discharge of
your first barrel, to be followed by the less murderous,
but still effective flying shot. On hearing the report,
it is his duty to dash instantly into the water, and
secure the slain as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p id="para_93">93. A really good water retriever is a scarce and
valuable animal. He should be neither white nor black,
because the colours are too conspicuous, especially the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
former, &#40;a hint by-the-bye for your own costume&#41;;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he
should be perfectly mute; of a patient disposition,
though active in the pursuit of birds; of so hardy a
constitution as not to mind the severest cold,&mdash;therefore
no coddling while he is young near a fire,&mdash;and possess
what many are deficient in, viz., a good nose: consequently,
a cross that will improve his nose, yet not
decrease his steadiness, is the great desideratum in
breeding. He should swim rapidly, for wild-fowl that
are only winged, will frequently escape from the quickest
dog, if they have plenty of sea-room and deep
water. &#40;See also <a href="#para_113">113</a>, <a href="#para_553">553</a>, <a href="#para_567">567</a>.&#41;</p>

<div class="pageheader">DUCK SHOOTING.</div>

<p id="para_94"><span class="small">94. Wildfowl emit a stronger scent than is, I believe, generally
supposed. At Mr. <span class="glue">G&mdash;&mdash;r&#8217;s</span>, in Surrey, Mr. <span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;g</span> was shooting
one day last season, when his pointer &#8220;Flint&#8221; drew for some time
towards the river, and brought the sportsmen to the stump of an
old tree. They could see nothing, and thought the dog must be
standing at a moorhen; but on one of the beaters trying with a
stick, out flew a mallard like a shot from a gun. As Mr. <span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;g</span>
levelled his tubes, it is unnecessary to observe that it fell; but
probably it would have been lost had not &#8220;Flint,&#8221; when encouraged,
jumped into the water and brought the bird to land. A Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;e</span>,
living near Edinburgh, whom I have the pleasure of knowing, has
a white setter that is a capital hand at finding ducks, and sets them
steadily.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">WILD-RICE LAKES.</div>

<p id="para_95">95. In the wild-<i>rice</i> lakes, as they are commonly
called, of America, a brace of highly-trained spaniels
will sometimes, on a windy day, afford you magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
sport. The cover is so good that, if it is not often
beaten, the birds will frequently get up singly, or only
a couple at a time. The dogs should keep swimming
about within gun-shot, while you are slowly and silently
paddling, or probably poling your canoe through the
most likely spots. Relays of spaniels are requisite, for
it is fatiguing work. If, by any rare chance, you are
situated where you can get much of this delightful
shooting, and <i>you are an enthusiast in training</i>, it may
be worth your while to consider whether there would
not be an advantage in making the dogs perfect in the
&#8220;down charge,&#8221; as they would then cease swimming the
instant you fired. But this long digression about
spaniels has led us away from your pup, which we
assumed &#40;<a href="#para_3">3</a>&#41; to be a pointer or setter, very unlike our
good Irish friend, well represented in the last engraving.</p>

<div class="pageheader">DOG FETCHING BIRD.</div>

<p id="para_96">96. Though you may not wish your young pointer
&#40;or setter&#41; to perform the duties of a regular retriever,
&#40;<a href="#para_536">536</a>&#41; still you would do well to teach him, whilst he is
a puppy, to fetch and deliver into your hand anything
soft you may occasionally throw for him, or leave behind
you in some place where he will have observed
you deposit it, while he is following at your heels. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a little time you can drop something <i>without</i> letting him
see you, and afterwards send him back for it. A
dog thus made, who is your intimate companion, becomes
so conversant with every article of your apparel,
and with whatever you usually carry about you, that,
should you accidentally drop anything, the observant
animal will be almost certain to recover it. On receiving
your order to be &#8220;off and find&#8221; he will accurately
retrace your footsteps for miles and miles, diligently
hunting every yard of the ground. Of course,
the distances to which you at first send your dog will
be inconsiderable, and you should carefully avoid persevering
too long at a time, lest he get sick of the lesson.
Indeed, in all his lessons,&mdash;as well in-doors as out,&mdash;but
particularly in this, let it be your aim to leave off
at a moment when he has performed entirely to your
satisfaction; that you may part the best of friends, and
that the last impression made by the lesson may be
pleasing as well as correct, from a grateful recollection
of the caresses which he has received. In wild-duck
shooting you may be in situations where you would be
very glad if the dog would bring your bird; and when
it is an active runner in cover, I fear you will be more
anxious than I could wish &#40;<a href="#para_322">322</a>&#41; that the dog should
&#8220;fetch.&#8221; It is probable that he will thus assist you if
he be practised as I have just advised; and such instruction
may lead, years hence, to his occasionally
bringing you some dead bird which he may come across,
and which you otherwise might have imagined you had
missed, for its scent might be too cold, and consequently
too changed, for the dog to have thought of regularly
pointing it.</p>

<p id="para_97"><span class="small">97. When I was a boy, I recollect seeing such an instance in
Kent. As a great treat, I was permitted &#40;but merely as a spectator&#41;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to accompany a first-rate shot, Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;h</span>, who was trying a gun
he thought of purchasing for his keeper. The dogs soon came upon
a covey. He killed with his first barrel, but apparently missed with
his second. He found fault with the gun for not shooting strongly;
and I well remember impertinently fancying,&mdash;but I dared not say
so,&mdash;that perhaps he was as much to blame as the gun. Soon afterwards,
to our mutual surprise, we saw one of the dogs trotting up
with a bird, still warm, in its mouth; thus tacitly reproving me for
not having done justice to Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;h&#8217;s</span> unerring eye and steady
hand.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">DELIVER INTO HAND.</div>

<p id="para_98">98. Mark my having said, &#8220;deliver into your hand,&#8221;
that your young dog may not be satisfied with only
dropping, within your sight, any bird he may lift, and
so, perhaps, leave it on the other side of a trout stream,
as I have seen dogs do more than once, in spite of every
persuasion and entreaty. With a young dog, who
retrieves, never pick up a bird yourself, however close
it may fall to you. Invariably, make him either deliver
it into your hand or lay it at your feet. The former is
by far the better plan. If the dog has at one moment
to drop the bird at <i>your</i> will, he is likely to fancy himself
privileged to drop it at another time for his <i>own</i>
convenience. In other respects, too, the former is the
safest method. I have a bitch now in my recollection,
who frequently lost her master slightly winged birds,
&#40;which she had admirably recovered&#41; by dropping them
too soon on hearing the report of a gun, or coming on
other game,&mdash;for off they ran, and fairly escaped, it
being impracticable, by any encouragement, to induce
her to seek for a bird she had once lifted.</p>

<p id="para_99"><span class="small">99. This error, I mean that of allowing a wounded bird to regain
its liberty, was once beautifully avoided by a pretty black retriever,
belonging to Colonel <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;y</span>, a good sportsman and pleasant companion,
who, not long since, told me the circumstance; and I am
glad to be able, on such authority, to relate an anecdote evincing so
much reflection and judgment, for I know not by what other terms
to characterise the dog&#8217;s sagacity.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">COLONEL <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;Y&#8217;S</span> VENUS.&mdash;FAN.</div>

<p id="para_100"><span class="small">100. Colonel <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;y&#8217;s</span> avocations constantly take him from his
neat bachelor&#8217;s cottage in Kent, to travel abroad. Shooting in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Hungary he once knocked down two partridges at a shot,&mdash;one was
killed outright, the other only slightly wounded. &#8220;Venus&#8221; soon
hit off the trail of the latter,&mdash;quickly overtook it, and, while
carrying it to her master, came upon the dead bird. She stopped,
evidently greatly puzzled; and, after one or two trials, finding she
could not take it up without permitting the escape of the winged
bird, she considered a moment,&mdash;then, deliberately murdered it, by
giving it a severe crunch, and afterwards brought away both together.
It is due to the lady to observe that she is naturally as tender-mouthed
as her name would imply her to be tender-hearted, and
that this is the only known instance of her ever having wilfully
injured any game.</span></p>

<p id="para_101"><span class="small">101. Sometimes a dog&#8217;s sagacity will induce him, <i>however little
taught</i>, to assist you in your hour of need; but you must not trust
to this. An intimate friend of mine, shooting in Ireland to a
pointer bitch that was totally unaccustomed to fetch and carry, but
well instructed to seek for a dead bird, killed a snipe. It fell in
soft, boggy ground, where he could not get at it to pick it up. After
some vain efforts to approach it, he hied on the bitch, who was still
steadily &#8220;pointing dead,&#8221; with &#8220;Fetch it, Fan; fetch it.&#8221; The bitch
seemed for a moment puzzled at such an unusual proceeding, and
looked round, inquisitively, once or twice, as if to say, &#8220;What can
you mean?&#8221; Suddenly, my friend&#8217;s dilemma seemed to flash upon
her. She walked on, took the bird, quite gently, in her mouth, and
carried it to where the ground was firm; but not one inch further
would she bring it, despite all the encouragement of her master,
who now wished to make her constantly retrieve. This was the
first and last bird she ever lifted.</span></p>

<p id="para_102"><span class="small">102. &#8220;Dove,&#8221; a white setter, belonging to a near relation of mine,
&#40;the left-hand dog in the engraving illustrating <a href="#ill_312_tb">540</a>, is considered
extremely like her,&#41; did, spontaneously, that which &#8220;Fan&#8221; only
consented to do after much entreaty. My relation, shooting on the
banks of the Forth, killed a partridge that was flying across the
river. As he had no retriever with him he almost regretted having
fired; but, to his surprise, &#8220;Dove&#8221; volunteered jumping into the
water; made her way to the bird with a sort of steamboat paddle
action,&mdash;for I verily believe it was the first time she had attempted
to swim,&mdash;seized it, and, returning with it to the shore, deposited it
safely on the bank. She never had retrieved before, and is not particularly
good at &#8220;seeking dead.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_103">103. I observed it was something soft which you
should teach your dog to fetch. Probably you have
seen a retriever taught to seek and bring a stone, upon
which, in a delicate manner, the tutor has spit. Does
it not stand to reason that the stone must have tended
to give his pupil a hard mouth? And what may, later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in life, cause him much misery in dashing at a bounding
stone, he may split a tooth. Dogs of an advanced age
suffer more in their mouths than most of us suspect.</p>

<p id="para_104">104. Should your pup be unwilling to enter water,
on no account push him in, under the mistaken idea
that it will reconcile him to the element,&mdash;it will but
augment his fears &#40;<a href="#para_320">320</a>&#41;. Rather, on a warm day, throw
some biscuit for him, when he is hungry, close to the
edge of the bank, where it is so shallow as merely to
require his wading. Chuck the next piece a little
further off, and, by degrees, increase the distance until
he gets beyond his depth, and finds that nature has
given him useful swimming powers. On no occasion
will the example of another dog more assist you. Your
youngster&#8217;s diving can never be of service; therefore
throw in only what will float. Otherwise he might
have a plunge for nothing, and so be discouraged; and
evidently it should be your constant aim to avoid doing
anything likely to shake his confidence in the judiciousness
of your orders.</p>

<p><span class="small">A person I know, taught a dog many good tricks,&mdash;among others,
to extinguish the papers thrown upon the ground that had served
to light cigars. A booby of a fellow, very wittily, took in the dog,
<i>once</i>, by chucking a red-hot coal to him. &#8220;A burnt child,&#8221; says the
old adage, &#8220;dreads the fire:&#8221; so does a burnt dog: and, of course,
no subsequent encouragement would induce him, ever again, to
approach a lighted paper.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">TAUGHT TO &#8220;FETCH.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_105">105. If you ever have occasion to teach a dog to dive
and retrieve, first accustom him, on land, to fetch something
heavy, of a conspicuous colour. When he brings
it eagerly, commence your diving lesson by throwing
it into the shallowest parts of the stream. Only by slow
degrees get to deep water, and let your lessons be very
short. Never chuck in a stone. The chances are twenty
to one that there are several at the bottom not very
dissimilar, and the young dog ought not to be subjected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to the temptation of picking up one of them in lieu of
that he was sent for. Should he on any occasion do so,
neither scold nor caress him; quietly take what he brings,
lay it at your feet, to show him that you want it not, and
endeavour to make him renew his search for what you
threw in; do this by signs, and by encouragement with
your voice, rather than by chucking stones in the right
direction, lest he should seek for them instead of searching
for what you originally sent him.</p>

<p id="para_106">106. Some teachers make a young dog fetch a round
pin-cushion, or a cork ball, in which needles are judiciously
buried; nor is it a bad plan, and there need
be no cruelty in it, if well managed. At least it can
only be cruel once, for a dog&#8217;s recollection of his sufferings
will prevent his picking up the offending object a
second time. Others, after he is well drilled into
&#8220;fetching,&#8221; and takes pleasure in it, will make him
bring a bunch of keys. There are few things a dog is
less willing to lift. Most probably they gave him some
severe rebuffs when first heedlessly snatching at them;
and the caution thereby induced tends to give him a
careful, tender mouth. A fencing master, I knew in
France, had a spaniel, singularly enough for a Frenchman,
called &#8220;Waterloo,&#8221; that would take up the smallest
needle.</p>

<p id="para_107">107. When your dog has picked up what you desired,
endeavour to make him run to you quickly. Many who
teach a dog to fetch, praise and encourage him while he
is bringing what he was sent after. Clearly this is an
error. It induces the dog to loiter and play with it.
He thinks he is lauded for having it in his mouth and
carrying it about. Reserve your encomiums and caresses
until he has delivered it. &#40;see <a href="#para_153">153</a>.&#41;&mdash;If you walk away,
the fear of your leaving him, will induce him to hurry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
after you. Let a dog retrieve ever so carelessly, still,
while on the move, he will rarely drop a bird.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BROUGHT TO LIFT WEIGHTS.</div>

<p id="para_108">108. Dogs that retrieve should be gradually brought
to lift heavy, flexible things, and such as require a large
grasp, that they may not be quite unprepared for the
weight and size of a hare; otherwise they may be inclined
to drag it along by a slight hold of the skin,
instead of balancing it across their mouths. Thus capacious
jaws are obviously an advantage in retrievers.</p>

<p>The French gamekeepers, many of whom are capital
hands at making a retriever &#40;excepting that they do not
teach the &#8220;down charge&#8221;&#41;, stuff a hare or rabbit skin
with straw, and when the dog has learned to fetch it
with eagerness, they progressively increase its weight
by burying larger and larger pieces of wood in the
middle of the straw: and to add to the difficulty of
carrying it, they often throw it to the other side of a
hedge or thick copse. If the dog shows any tendency
to a hard mouth they mix thorns with the straw.</p>

<div class="pageheader">TAUGHT TO &#8220;FETCH.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_109">109. I ought to have mentioned sooner, that you
should commence teaching a puppy to &#8220;fetch,&#8221; by
shaking your glove &#40;or anything soft&#41; at him, and encouraging
him to seize and drag it from you. Then
throw it a yard or two off, gradually increasing the
distance, and the moment he delivers it to you, give
him something palatable. It is easier to teach a dog to
retrieve as a puppy than when he is older. From teething
his gums are in a state of slight irritation, and it
gives him pleasure to employ his teeth and gums.
Should you, contrary to every reasonable expectation,
from his having no inclination to romp or play with the
glove, not be able to persuade him to pick it up, put it
between his teeth,&mdash;force him to grasp it by tightly
pressing his jaws together, speaking all the while impressively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to him,&mdash;scold him if he is obstinate and
refuses to take hold of the glove. After a little time
retire a few paces, keeping one hand under his mouth
&#40;to prevent his dropping the glove&#41;, while you lead or
drag him with the other. When you halt, be sure not
to take the glove immediately from him,&mdash;oblige him
to continue holding it for at least a minute, &#40;lest he
should learn to relinquish his grip too soon&#41; before you
make him yield at the command &#8220;give;&#8221; then bestow
a reward. Should he drop it before he is ordered to
deliver it, replace it in his mouth, and again retreat
some steps before ordering him to &#8220;give.&#8221; He will
soon follow with it at your heels. If you have sufficient
perseverance you can thus make him earn all his
daily food. Hunger will soon perfect him in the lesson.
Observe that there are four distinct stages in this trick
of carrying,&mdash;the first, making the dog grasp and retain,&mdash;the
second, inducing him to bring, following at your
heels,&mdash;the third, teaching him not to quit his hold
when you stop,&mdash;the fourth, getting him to deliver into
your hands on your order. The great advantage of a
sporting dog&#8217;s acquiring this trick, is, that it accustoms
him to deliver into your <i>hands</i>; and it often happens
that you must thus teach a dog to &#8220;carry&#8221; as a preparative
to teaching him to &#8220;fetch.&#8221; It certainly will
be judicious in you to do so, if the dog is a lively,
riotous animal; for the act of carrying the glove &#40;or
stick, &amp;c.&#41; quietly at your heels will sober him, and
make him less likely to run off with it instead of delivering
it when you are teaching him to fetch. As
soon as he brings the glove tolerably well, try him with
a short stick. You will wish him not to seize the end
of it, lest he should learn to &#8220;drag&#8221; instead of to
&#8220;carry.&#8221; Therefore fix pegs or wires into holes drilled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
at right angles to each other at the extremities of the
stick. He will then only grasp it near the middle.</p>

<div class="pageheader">TAUGHT TO &#8220;CARRY.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_110"><span class="small">110. On one occasion I had a brace of setters to instruct, which
had come to me perfectly untaught, at far too advanced an age to
make their education an easy task; they had also been harshly
treated, and were consequently shy and timid. This obliged me to
proceed with much caution and gentleness. I soon won their confidence,
I may say, their affections; but I could not persuade them
to play with my glove, nor to lift anything I threw before them.
I was hesitating how to act, when I saw one of them find an old dry
bone and bear it off in triumph. I encouraged him in carrying
it,&mdash;threw it several times for him, and when he was tired of the
fun, I brought the old bone home as a valuable prize. Next day
I tied a string to it,&mdash;I frequently chucked it to a short distance,
and when the dog had seized it I dragged it towards me, <i>generally
turning my back to the dog</i>. As soon as I regained it, I made him
attach a value to its being in my hands, by employing it as a plate
on which to offer him some delicacy. In a few days I could dispense
with the string, and I soon ventured to substitute for the bone the
string rolled up as a ball; afterwards I employed a stick. Ultimately
the dog fetched very promptly. His companion also took
up the trick from the force of good example. &#40;See note to <a href="#para_34">34</a>.&#41;</span></p>

<p id="para_111"><span class="small">111. I have dwelt thus long on &#8220;carrying&#8221; and &#8220;fetching,&#8221;

<p id="para_112">112. This drill should be further extended if a</p>

<p class="noindent">be your pupil. Throw dead birds of any kind for him
to bring &#40;of course one at a time&#41;, being on the alert to
check him whenever he grips them too severely. If he
persists in disfiguring them, pass a few blunted knitting
needles through them at right angles to one another.
When he fetches with a tender mouth, you will be able
to follow up this method of training still further by
letting him &#8220;road&#8221; &#40;or &#8220;foot,&#8221; as it is often termed&#41;
a rabbit in high stubble, one &#40;or both, if a strong buck&#41;
of whose hind-legs you will have previously bandaged
in the manner described in <a href="#para_60">60</a>. Be careful not to let
him see you turn it out, lest he watch your proceedings
and endeavour to &#8220;hunt by eye.&#8221; Indeed, it might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
better to employ another person to turn it out. Keep
clear of woods for some time:&mdash;the cross scents would
puzzle him. If by any chance you have a winged
pheasant or partridge, let him retrieve it. You will
not, I presume, at the commencement select a morning
when there is a dry cold wind from the north-east, but
probably you will wish to conclude his initiatory lessons
on days which you judge to possess least scent. The
more he has been practised as described in <a href="#para_43">43</a>, the
better will he work; for he cannot keep his nose too
perseveringly close to the ground. With reference to
the instructions in that paragraph I will here remark,
that before you let the dog stoop to hunt, you should
have placed him by signal &#40;<a href="#para_35">35</a>&#41; near the spot from which
you had begun dragging the bread. In paragraph <a href="#para_277">277</a>
an instance is given of the manner in which a dog who
retrieves should be put upon a scent; and why that
mode is adopted is explained in <a href="#para_271">271</a>.</p>

<p id="para_113">113. It is quite astonishing how well an old dog that
retrieves knows when a bird is struck. He instantly
detects any hesitation or uncertainty of movement, and
for a length of time will watch its flight with the
utmost eagerness, and, steadily keeping his eye on it,
will, as surely as yourself, mark its fall. To induce a
young dog to become thus observant, always let him
perceive that <i>you</i> watch a wounded bird with great
eagerness; his imitative instinct will soon lead him to
do the same. This faculty of observation is particularly
serviceable in a water retriever. It enables him to
swim direct to the crippled bird, and, besides the saving
of time, the less he is in the water in severe weather,
the less likely is he to suffer from rheumatism.</p>

<p id="para_114">114. As an initiatory lesson in making him observant
of the flight and fall of birds, place a few pigeons &#40;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
other birds&#41; during his absence, each in a hole covered
with a tile. Afterwards come upon these spots apparently
unexpectedly, and, kicking away the tiles,
&#40;or, what is better, dragging them off by a previously
adjusted string,&#41; shoot the birds for him to bring; it
being clearly understood that he has been previously
tutored into having no dread of the gun. As he will have
been taught to search where bidden &#40;<span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_IV">iv</a>.</span> to <span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_VIII">viii</a>.</span> of 141&#41;,
nothing now remains but to take him out on a regular
campaign, when the fascinating scent of game will
infallibly make him search &#40;I do not say deliver&#41; with
great eagerness. When once he then touches upon a
scent, leave him entirely to himself,&mdash;not a word, not a
sign. Possibly his nose may not be able to follow the
bird, but it is certain that yours cannot. Occasionally
you may be able to help an old retriever &#40;<a href="#para_544">544</a>&#41;, but rarely,
if ever, a young one. Your interference, nay, probably
your mere presence, would so excite him as to make
him overrun the scent. Remain, therefore, quietly
where you are, until he rejoins you.</p>

<div class="pageheader">WATCHES FLIGHT OF BIRDS.</div>

<p id="para_115">115. When we see a winged pheasant racing off, most
of us are too apt to assist a young dog, forgetting that
we thereby teach him, instead of devoting his whole
attention to work out the scent, to turn to us for aid
on occasions when it may be impossible to give it.
When a dog is hunting <i>for</i> birds, he should frequently
look to the gun for signals, but when he is <i>on</i> them, he
should trust to nothing but his own scenting faculties.</p>

<p id="para_116">116. If, from a judicious education, a retriever pup
has had a delight in &#8220;fetching&#8221; rapidly, it is not likely
he will loiter on the way to mouth his birds; but the
fatigue of carrying a hare a considerable distance may,
perhaps, induce a young dog to drop it in order to take
a moment&#8217;s rest. There is a risk that when doing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
he may be tempted to lick the blood, and, finding it
palatable, be led to maul the carcase. You see, therefore,
the judiciousness of employing every means in
your power to ensure his feeling anxious to deliver
<i>quickly</i>, and I know not what plan will answer better,&mdash;though
it sounds sadly unsentimental,&mdash;than to have
some pieces of hard boiled liver<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> at hand to bestow
upon him the moment he surrenders his game, until
he is thoroughly confirmed in an expeditious delivery.
Never give him a piece, however diligently he may
have searched, unless he succeed in bringing. When
you leave off these rewards do so gradually. The
invariable bestowal of such dainties during, at least,
the retriever&#8217;s first season, will prevent his ever dropping
a bird on hearing the report of a gun &#40;as many do&#41;,
in order to search for the later killed game.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BIT FOR BLOOD-SUCKER.</div>

<p id="para_117">117. Should a young retriever evince any wish to
assist the cook by plucking out the feathers of a bird;
or from natural vice or mismanagement before he came
into your possession,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> show any predisposition to taste
blood, take about two feet &#40;dependent upon the size of
the dog&#8217;s head&#41; of iron wire, say the one-eighth of an
inch in diameter, sufficiently flexible for <i>you</i>, but not
for <i>him</i>, to bend. Shape this much into the form of the
letter U, supposing the extremities to be joined by a
straight line. Place the straight part in the dog&#8217;s
mouth, and passing the other over his head and ears,
retain it in position by a light throat lash passed
through a turn in the wire, as here roughly represented.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
The flexibility of the wire will enable you to
adjust it with ease to the shape of his head. When in
the kennel he ought to be occasionally thus
bitted, that he may not fret when he is first
hunted with it. It will not injure his teeth
or much annoy him, if it lies on his grinders
a little behind the tushes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_084" id="ill_084"></a>
<img src="images/ill_084.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="122" />
</div>

<p id="para_118">118. Sometimes a retriever, notwithstanding every
encouragement, will not pursue a winged bird with
sufficient rapidity. In this case associate him for a few
days with a quicker dog, whose example will to a certainty
animate him and increase his pace. It is true
that when he is striving to hit off a scent he cannot
work too patiently and perseveringly; but, on the other
hand, the moment he is satisfied he is on it, he cannot
follow too rapidly. A winged bird when closely pressed,
seems, through nervousness, to emit an increasing stream
of scent; therefore, though it may sound paradoxical,
the retriever&#8217;s accelerated pace then makes him &#40;his
nose being close to the ground&#41; the less likely to overrun
it; and the faster he pursues the less ground must he
disturb, for the shorter will be the chase.</p>

<div class="pageheader">THE &#8220;DOWN CHARGE.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_119">119. Retrievers are generally taught to rush in, the
instant a bird falls. This plan, like most other things,
has its advocates and its opponents. I confess to being
one of the latter, for I cannot believe that in the long
run it is the best way to fill the bag. I think it certain
that more game is lost by birds being flushed while the
guns are unloaded,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> than could be lost from the scent
cooling during the short period the dog remains at the
&#8220;down charge.&#8221; Unquestionably some retrievers have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
so good a nose, that the delay would not lead to their
missing any wounded game, however slightly struck
&#40;<a href="#para_123">123</a>&#41;; and the delay has this great advantage, that it
helps to keep the retriever under proper subjection, and
diminishes his anxiety to rush to every part of the line
where a gun may be fired, instead of remaining quietly
at his master&#8217;s heels until signaled to take up the scent.
Moreover, a retriever, by neglecting the &#8220;down charge,&#8221;
sets an example to the pointers or setters who may be
his companions, which it is always more or less difficult
to prevent the dogs, if young, from following. But I
once shot over a retriever which I could hardly wish
not to have &#8220;run on shot.&#8221; On a bird being hit he
started off with the greatest impetuosity, kept his eye
immoveably fixed on its flight, and possessed such speed,
that a winged bird scarcely touched the ground ere it
was pinned. He would, too, often seize a slightly
injured hare before it had acquired its best pace. The
pursuit so soon terminated, that possibly less game
escaped being fired at, than if the retriever had not
stirred until the guns were reloaded. On a miss he was
never allowed&mdash;indeed appeared little inclined&mdash;to quit
&#8220;heel.&#8221; Of course a trainer&#8217;s trouble is decreased by
not breaking to the &#8220;down charge,&#8221; which may induce
some to recommend the plan; though it is to be observed,
that this class of dogs is more easily than any
other perfected in it, because the breaker nearly always
possesses the power of treading upon or seizing the
checkcord the instant a bird is sprung.</p>

<p id="para_120">120. The nature of your shooting will much influence
you in deciding which of the two methods to adopt;
but should you select the one which the generality of
good sportsmen consider to be most according to rule,
and to possess the greatest beauty, viz., the &#8220;down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
charge,&#8221; rather lose any bird, however valuable, so long
as your retriever remains young, than put him on the
&#8220;foot&#8221; a second before you have reloaded. Undoubtedly
it ought to be taught to every dog broken for sale, as the
purchaser can always dispense with it should he judge
it unnecessary:&mdash;it can soon be untaught. It is clear
that not &#8220;quitting heel&#8221; until ordered, is tantamount
to the regular &#8220;down charge,&#8221; but I think the last is the
easiest to enforce constantly. It is the more decided
step.</p>

<div class="pageheader">MR. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;G&#8217;S</span> &#8220;BEN.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_121"><span class="small">121. Mr. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> &#40;mentioned in <a href="#para_231">231</a>&#41; had a famous retriever
whose build, close curly hair, and aquatic propensities, showed his
close affinity to the water spaniel, though doubtless there was some
strain of the Landsman. He retrieved with singular zeal and pertinacity.
Indeed his superiority over all competitors in his neighbourhood,
was so generally admitted, that his master was hardly
ever asked to shoot at any place, without a special invitation being
sent to &#8220;Ben.&#8221; When beating a cover, there was a constant call
for &#8220;Ben.&#8221; No merely winged pheasant fell to the ground, and no
hare went off wounded but there was heard, &#8220;Ben, Ben.&#8221; On one
occasion, when <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> was posted at the extremity of the line, the
dog was called away so often that his master got annoyed, and
declared that the animal should attend to no one but himself. Soon
there was a double shot, and, of course, the usual vociferations for
&#8220;Ben,&#8221; but he was ordered to keep close. Louder and louder were
the cries for &#8220;Ben,&#8221; but all in vain,&mdash;he obediently followed only
his master&#8217;s orders. At length when the cover was beaten through,
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> inquired into the cause of the hubbub. Young <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;k</span>
told him, in no kind humour, that his churlishness in retaining the
dog had lost them a fine hare. &#8220;If,&#8221; said <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, &#8220;you are certain
you wounded it, and can put me on the exact spot where it was
when you fired, I will bet you &pound;5 that &#8216;Ben&#8217; shall find her.&#8221;
<span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;k</span> observed that he knew perfectly the precise place, having
carefully marked it with a stick, but added, that he much doubted
the possibility of the dog&#8217;s picking up the scent, as more than half
an hour had since elapsed. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, however, stuck to his offer.
They went back and found some pile, which proved that the hare
had been struck. The dog was put on the trail. He at once took
it, but was so long away, &#40;perhaps twenty minutes,&#41; that they
thought it best to search for him. They found him almost immediately,
lying down with the hare alongside of him. His tongue
was hanging out of his mouth, and he showed other symptoms of
great distress. Evidently he had brought the hare from a considerable
distance.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BEN&#8217;S REFLECTIONS.</div>

<p id="para_122"><span class="small">122. &#8220;Ben&#8221; had numerous excellent qualities, but his greatest
admirers, and few dogs had so many, were obliged to admit, that he
was of a quarrelsome, pugnacious disposition. It unluckily happened
that he had taken a great dislike to a large cubbish young
retriever belonging to the aforesaid Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;k</span>, who often shot
with <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>; and I am sorry to say none of &#8220;Ben&#8217;s&#8221; prejudices
were removed by the kindly fellowship and good feeling usually
engendered by association in field-sports. The day&#8217;s work generally
commenced by &#8220;Ben&#8217;s&#8221; making a rush at his big awkward companion,
and overturning him. After this feat, upon which he
evidently greatly plumed himself, he would proceed to business. It
happened that one of the sportsmen once knocked over a pheasant
which fell outside the hedge surrounding the copse they were beating.
It proved to be a runner; &#8220;Ben,&#8221; however, soon got hold of it, and
was carrying it to his master in the cover, when up came the other
dog wishing to assist. &#8220;Ben&#8217;s&#8221; anger was roused,&mdash;he was anxious
to punish such intrusive interference&mdash;but how to manage it was
the question, for if he put down the winged bird it would run into
the wood, where there might be much trouble in recovering it.
Quick as thought, off ran &#8220;Ben&#8221; to the middle of the large ploughed
field,&mdash;there he dropped the bird,&mdash;then dashed at his lumbering
rival, quickly gave him a thrashing, and afterwards started in
pursuit of the pheasant, which he managed to overtake before it
regained the copse. If that was not reflection it was something
very like it.</span></p>

<p id="para_123"><span class="small">123. One more anecdote of poor &#8220;Ben.&#8221; I say &#8220;poor,&#8221; because
he died prematurely from a swelling under the throat which might,
in all probability, have been cured, had a long seton been run
through it, or rather under the adjacent skin,&mdash;a mode of treatment
attended with the happiest results in the case of another dog
attacked in a similar manner in the same kennel. &#8220;Ben&#8221; and an
old setter were <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g&#8217;s</span> only canine attendants when he was once
pheasant shooting with a friend on some steep banks. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>
was at the bottom, his friend on the top. A cock-pheasant was
sprung and winged by the latter. The bird not being immediately
found, there was the usual cry for &#8220;Ben.&#8221; &#8220;Go along,&#8221; said
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>. Away went the dog, who soon took up the scent and
dashed off, but had not gone many yards before he started a hare;
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> had soon an opening to fire, and wounded it. &#8220;Ben&#8221;
pursued it, urged on by his master, who felt sure the dog would be
able to retrieve the pheasant afterwards. The hare was viewed
scrambling up the bank. &#8220;Ben&#8221; soon appeared in sight and caught
it. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g&#8217;s</span> friend much abused poor &#8220;Ben&#8221; for quitting one
scent for another. &#8220;Do not put yourself out of humour,&#8221; said
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>; &#8220;you don&#8217;t know the dog,&mdash;wait till he comes back, and
if he does not then get the bird, blame me.&#8221; Having allowed
&#8220;Ben&#8221; a little breathing time, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> took him to the place where
the bird fell. The dog quickly hit off the scent, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, now
perfectly satisfied that all was right, made his friend sit down. In
little more than a quarter of an hour &#8220;Ben&#8221; came back with the bird
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
alive in his mouth, it having no other wound that could be perceived
than on the pinion of one wing.</span></p>

<p id="para_124"><span class="small">124. With such a nose as &#8220;Ben&#8217;s&#8221; could there have been any
harm in his being taught to &#8220;down charge,&#8221; and might there not
have been much good &#40;<a href="#para_119">119</a>&#41;? You see that owing to his having put
up the hare while <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g&#8217;s</span> friend was loading, it might have
escaped, had it, as is usually the case, at once taken to the hills.</span></p>

<p id="para_125">125. Large retrievers are less apt to mouth their game
than small ones: but very heavy dogs are not desirable,
for they soon tire. And yet a certain medium is necessary,
for they ought to have sufficient strength to carry
a hare with ease through a thicket, when balanced in
their jaws, and be able to jump a fence with her. They
should run mute. And they should be thick-coated:
unless they are so,&mdash;I do not say long-coated,&mdash;they
cannot be expected to dash into close cover, or plunge
into water after a duck or snipe when the thermometer
is near zero.</p>

<div class="pageheader">THE TRUE NEWFOUNDLAND.</div>

<p id="para_126"><span class="small">126. From education there are good retrievers of many breeds,
but it is usually allowed that, as a general rule, the best land
retrievers are bred from a cross between the setter and the Newfoundland,&mdash;or
the strong spaniel and the Newfoundland. I do not
mean the heavy Labrador, whose weight and bulk is valued because
it adds to his power of draught, nor the Newfoundland, increased
in size at Halifax and St. John&#8217;s to suit the taste of the English
purchaser,&mdash;but the far slighter dog reared by the settlers on the
coast,&mdash;a dog that is quite as fond of water as of land, and which
in almost the severest part of a North American winter will remain
on the edge of a rock for hours together, watching intently for anything
the passing waves may carry near him. Such a dog is highly
prized. Without his aid the farmer would secure but few of the
many wild ducks he shoots at certain seasons of the year. The
patience with which he waits for a shot on the top of a high cliff
&#40;until the numerous flock sail leisurely underneath&#41; would be fruitless,
did not his noble dog fearlessly plunge in from the greatest
height, and successfully bring the slain to shore.</span></p>

<p id="para_127"><span class="small">127. Probably a cross from the heavy, large-headed setter, who,
though so wanting in pace, has an exquisite nose; and the true
Newfoundland, makes the best retriever. Nose is the first desideratum.
A breaker may doubt which of his pointers or setters
possesses the greatest olfactory powers, but a short trial tells him
which of his retrievers has the finest nose.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p id="para_128">128. Making a first-rate retriever is a work of time,
but his being <i>thoroughly</i> grounded in the required
initiatory lessons facilitates matters surprisingly. Indeed
after having been taught the &#8220;drop&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_23">23</a>, <a href="#para_25">25</a>, <a href="#para_26">26</a>&#41;&mdash;to
&#8220;fetch&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_107">107</a> to <a href="#para_109">109</a>&#41;&mdash;and &#8220;seek dead&#8221; in the
precise direction he is ordered &#40;<span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_XI">xi</a>.</span> of 141&#41;, almost any
kind of dog can be made to retrieve. The better his
nose is, the better of course he will retrieve. Sagacity,
good temper, quickness of comprehension, a teachable
disposition, and all cultivated qualities, are almost as
visibly transmitted to offspring as shape and action;
therefore the stronger a dog&#8217;s hereditary instincts lead
him to retrieve, the less will be the instructor&#8217;s trouble;
and the more obedient he is made to the signals of the
hand, the more readily will he be put upon a scent.
Dogs that are by nature quick rangers do not take
instinctively to retrieving. They have not naturally
sufficient patience to work out a feeble scent. They are
apt to overrun it. A really good retriever will pursue a
wounded bird or hare as accurately as a bloodhound will
a deer or man; and if he is put on a false scent, I mean
a scent of uninjured flick or feather, he will not follow
it beyond a few steps:&mdash;experience will have shown him
the inutility of so doing. &#40;<a href="#para_545">545</a>.&#41;</p>

<div class="pageheader">RETRIEVE WOODCOCK.</div>

<p id="para_129">129. Avail yourself of the first opportunity to make a
young retriever lift a woodcock, lest in after life, from
its novel scent, he decline touching it, as many dogs
have done to the great annoyance of their masters.
Ditto, with the delicate landrail.</p>

<div class="pageheader">NO RAT-HUNTING.</div>

<p id="para_130"><span class="small">130. The directions given about &#8220;fetching,&#8221; led me
to talk of retrievers; and having touched upon the
subject, I thought it right not to quit it, until I had
offered the best advice in my power. I have but one
more recommendation to add before I return to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
setter &#40;or pointer&#41; pup: carefully guard a young retriever
&#40;indeed any dog bred for the gun&#41; from being
ever allowed to join in a rat-hunt. Rat-hunting would
tend to destroy his tenderness of mouth, nay possibly
make him mangle his game. But this is not all. It has
often gradually led good dogs to decline lifting hares or
rabbits, apparently regarding them more in the light of
vermin than of game. Some dogs, however, that are
not bad retrievers, are capital ratters, but they are exceptions
to the general rule. Indeed, you should never
permit your dog to retrieve any kind of ground or
winged vermin. If the creature were only wounded it
might turn upon him. He in self-defence would give it
a grip, and he might thus be led to follow the practice
on less pardonable occasions. Remember, that a winged
bittern or heron might peck out his eye.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BUSINESS IN HAND.</div>

<p id="para_131">131. As I before observed, you can practise most of
the initiatory lessons in your country walks. Always
put something alluring in your pocket to reward your
pupil for prompt obedience. Do not take him out unnecessarily
in bad weather. On no account let him
amuse himself by scraping acquaintance with every idle
cur he meets on the way; nor permit him to gambol
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
about the lanes. Let him understand by your manner
that there is business in hand. Never let him enter a
field before you. <i>Always keep him at your heels, until
you give him the order to be off.</i> You will find him disposed
to presume and encroach. According to the old
adage, &#8220;Give him an inch, and he will take an ell.&#8221; He
will be endeavouring to lead rather than to follow, and,
should he fancy himself unobserved, he will most perseveringly
steal inch upon inch in advance. Be ever on
the watch, ready to check the <i>beginning</i> of every act of
disobedience. Implicit obedience in trifles will insure
it in things of more importance&mdash;but see par. <a href="#para_345">345</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_092" id="ill_092"></a>

<p class="caption">INCLINED TO &#8216;RAT.&#8217;</p>
</div>

<div class="pageheader">INSTRUCTION IN QUARTERING.</div>

<p id="para_132">132. For some time, but the period is uncertain,&mdash;say
from his being eight months old until double that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
age,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>&mdash;he will merely gallop and frisk about, and probably
will take diligently to persecuting butterflies. Let
him choose what he likes. Don&#8217;t think that he will prize
small beer, when he can get champagne. He will leave
off noticing inferior articles as he becomes conversant
with the taste of game. It is now your main object to
get him to hunt; no matter what, so that he is not perpetually
running to &#8220;heel.&#8221; And the more timid he is,
the more you must let him chase, and amuse himself as
his fancy dictates. When you see that he is really
occupying himself with more serious hunting, <i>eagerly</i>
searching for small birds, especially larks, you must
begin instructing him how to quarter his ground to the
greatest advantage, <i>under your constant direction</i>. Should
any one join you, or anything occur likely to prevent
your giving him your strictest attention, on no account
permit him to range,&mdash;keep him to &#8220;heel&#8221; until you
are quite prepared to watch and control all his movements.
Hunt him where he is least likely to find game,
for he will take to quartering his ground far more regularly,
under your guidance, where his attention is least
distracted by any scent. The taint of partridge would
be almost sure to make him deviate from the true line
on which you are anxious he should work. Labour now
diligently, if possible daily, though not for many hours
a day; for be assured, a good method of ranging can
only be implanted when he is young: but be discreet,
if he be naturally timid, you may make him afraid to
leave your heel&mdash;the worst of faults.</p>

<p id="para_133">133. Should your pup be so long before taking to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
hunting that your patience becomes exhausted, let an
old dog accompany you a few times. When <i>he</i> finds
birds, gradually bring the young one upon them from
leeward, and let him spring them. Encourage him to
sniff the ground they have quitted, and allow him to
run riot on the haunt. After that enjoyment, the
example of the old dog will most likely soon make
him range, and employ his nose in seeking a repetition
of what has afforded him such unexpected delight. If
it does not, and the old dog is steady and good-humoured
enough to bear the annoyance cheerfully, couple the
young one to him. Before this he should have learned
to work kindly in couples &#40;<a href="#para_48">48</a>&#41;. But I am getting on
too fast, and swerving from the track I had marked for
myself. By-and-by I will tell you how I think you
should instruct your youngster to quarter his ground to
the best advantage. &#40;<a href="#para_173">173</a>, &amp;c.&#41;</p>

<div class="pageheader">GAIN AFFECTION.</div>

<p id="para_134">134. Common sense shows that you ought not to
correct your dog for disobedience, unless you are certain
that he knows his fault. Now you will see that the
initiatory lessons I recommend, must give him that
knowledge, for they explain to him the meaning of
almost all the signs and words of command you will
have to employ when shooting. That knowledge, too,
is imparted by a system of rewards, not punishments.
Your object is not to break his spirit, but his self-will.
With his obedience you gain his affection. The greatest
hardship admissible, in this early stage of his education,
is a strong jerk of the checkcord, and a sound rating,
given, <i>when necessary</i>, in the loudest tone and sternest
manner; and it is singular how soon he will discriminate
between the reproving term &#8220;bad&#8221; &#40;to which he
will sensitively attach a feeling of shame&#41;, and the
encouraging word &#8220;good,&#8221;&mdash;expressions that will hereafter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
have a powerful influence over him, especially if
he be of a gentle, timid disposition.</p>

<p id="para_135">135. In educating such a dog,&mdash;and there are many
of the kind, likely to turn out well, if they are judiciously
managed, often possessing noses so exquisite &#40;perhaps
I ought to say cautious&#41;, as nearly to make up for their
general want of constitution and powers of endurance:&mdash;it
is satisfactory to think that all these lessons can be
inculcated without in the slightest degree depressing his
spirit. On the contrary, increasing observation and intelligence
will gradually banish his shyness and distrust
of his own powers; for he will be sensible that he is
becoming more and more capable of comprehending
your wishes, and therefore less likely to err and be
punished &#40;<a href="#para_347">347</a>&#41;.</p>

<div class="pageheader">FURTHER KNOWLEDGE READILY GAINED.</div>

<p id="para_136">136. I fear you may imagine that I am attributing
too much reasoning power to him. You would not think
so if you had broken in two or three dogs. What makes
dog-teaching, if not very attractive, at least not laborious,
is the fact that the more you impart to a dog, the
more readily will he gain further knowledge. After
teaching a poodle or a terrier a few tricks, you will be
surprised to see with what increasing facility he will
acquire each successive accomplishment. It is this
circumstance which, I think, should induce you not to
regard as chimerical the perfection of which I purpose
to speak by-and-by, under the head of &#8220;refinements in
breaking.&#8221; Indeed I only adopt this distinction in
deference to what I cannot but consider popular prejudice;
for I well know many will regard such accomplishments
as altogether superfluous. It is sad to think
that an art which might easily be made much more
perfect, is allowed, almost by universal sufferance, to stop
short just at the point where excellence is within grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<div class="pageheader">ESQUIMAUX DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_137">137. Far more dogs would be <i>well broken</i>, if men
would but keep half the number they usually possess.
<i>The owner of many dogs cannot shoot often enough over
them to give them great experience.</i></p>

<p><span class="small">Is it that some youngsters are fond of the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of a large kennel?
That can hardly be, or ought not to be; for clearly it would be more
sportsmanlike to pride themselves upon the rare qualities of a few
highly-trained animals. A lover of the trigger might be excused an
occasional boast, if made with an approach to truth, that he shot over
the best broken dogs in the county. I say seriously, that if I had
a considerable bet upon the quantity of game that I was to kill in a
season, I had much rather possess two perfectly educated dogs than
half-a-dozen commonly called broken;&mdash;and even if I gave fifty or
sixty guineas for the brace, it would be more economical than to
purchase twice as many of the everyday sort; for, to say nothing of
the tax-gatherer, consider what would be the saving at the end of
a very few years between the keep of <i>two</i>, and of four or five dogs.
I suspect the difference would soon repay the large price paid for
the highly-educated favourites. Oh! yes. I anticipate what you
would say; but, keen sportsman as I am, I own I have not time or
inclination to shoot oftener than three or four out of the six working-days
of the week,&mdash;and I suspect not many men have, except just
at the beginning of a season. Moreover, in reference to what I
fancy are your thoughts respecting the insufficiency of two, I must
premise that they are to be good-hearted dogs,&mdash;good feeders after
work,&mdash;probably of the sort whose exuberant animal spirits, untiring
energies, and rapture at inhaling the exciting perfume of game, have
led them to run riot in many a lawless chase; who have consequently
used up more than their fair share of the breaker&#8217;s checkcord, and
consumed an undue portion of his time. They must not be those
whose constitutions have been injured in their growth by excessive
work; for dogs vary as much as horses in the quantity of labour
they are able to perform, both from diversity of natural capabilities,
and from the greater or less care bestowed upon them while progressing
towards maturity. The Esquimaux, who from anxious
observation must be a competent judge,&mdash;his very existence depending
upon the powers and endurance of his dogs,&mdash;not only
occasionally crosses them with the wolf &#40;the progeny is prolific&#41; to
increase their strength and hardiness,&mdash;I do not say sagacity,&mdash;but
he is so impressed with the necessity of not overtasking them until
they have attained their full stamina and vigour, that although he
breaks them into harness before they are quite a twelvemonth old,
when their immediate services would be convenient, he yet abstains
from putting them to severe labour until they are nearly three years
of age. My supposed dogs must, too, have as united a gallop as a
good hunter, and have small, round, hard feet; for this I hold to be
a more certain test of endurance in the field, than any other point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that you can name. Rest assured, that the worst loined dogs with
good feet<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> are capable of more fatigue in stubble or heather, than
the most muscular and best loined, with fleshy &#8220;understandings.&#8221;
The most enduring pointers I have ever seen hunted, had more or
less of the strain of the fox-hound; but doubtless they were proportionately
hard to break, for their hereditary bias on one side of
the house must have given them an inclination to chase and carry
their heads low. I have shot over a cross with the bull-dog. The
animal showed great courage, perseverance, and nose, but he hunted
with his head so near the ground, that he hit off no game unless he
came upon its run. The strongest heather could not have cured
such a sad carriage. It would be quite unreasonable to expect that
dogs so bred &#40;from either fox-hound or bull-dog&#41;, would have acted
like Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t&#8217;s</span>, &#40;see <a href="#para_280">280</a>&#41; the first day they were shown game.
Remember also that I do not expect to lose any shots from the birds
being scared by my being forced to call or whistle to the dogs, and
that I confidently hope to shoot more coolly and collectedly, from
not being worried and annoyed by their misconduct; I allow, however,
that in any open country more than two dogs are desirable;
and I especially admit, that whenever I might have the good luck
to get away to the moors, I should be unwilling to start with no
more than a brace; but even in this case, as I should hope for
better society than my own, have I not a right to calculate upon the
probable contingent to be brought by my friend? and if his turned
out superior to mine, we should always reserve his for our evening&#8217;s
beat, which ought to be the best feeding ground, and towards which
it would be our endeavour throughout the day to drive the birds;
for, unlike the partridge, the later it is, <i>early in the season</i>, the better
grouse lie. Many dogs are desirable, not that they may be hunted
together, but that they may be hunted in reliefs. But some possess
so much power and bottom, that their owners need seldom think
about reliefs in partridge-shooting.</span></p>

<p id="para_138"><span class="small">138. In enlarging a kennel, it ought always to be remembered,
that the companionship of one disorderly cur nominally cheap, but
in reality dear, soon leads astray the better disposed. Men who
spare no expense in preserving their grounds, in rearing and feeding
birds, &amp;c. will often be found to begrudge a few extra pounds in the
purchase of a dog, however good. This appears odd, but it is too
true. If they would but sum up the rent they pay for the right of
shooting, &#40;or what is the same thing, its value, if they choose to let
it&#41;, the wages of men, the cost of breeding game, taxes, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
other attendant expenses, they would find that they wreck themselves

<div class="pageheader">IRELAND GROUSE-SHOOTING.</div>

<p id="para_139">139. I am, however, wandering from our immediate
subject. Let us return to the lecture, and consider how
much knowledge your pupil will have acquired by these
preliminary instructions. We shall find that, with the
exception of a systematically confirmed range, really
little remains to be learned, save what his almost unaided
instinct will tell him.</p>

<p><span class="small">I will give you an instance of what I mean in the conduct of a
young pointer I saw shot over the first day he was ever shown
game. You know that in Ireland grouse-shooting does not commence
before the 20th of August,&mdash;a date far more judicious than
ours. I well remember that day at Clonmel in the year 1828. Long
before any glimmering of light, one of our party had fractured the
stock of a favourite double barrel, by carelessly letting it hang
across his body at the moment a skittish cob he was riding rushed
through a narrow gateway. The extremities of the gun caught the
side-posts, and if it had not given way, he must have parted company
with his nag. I believe we each made a memorandum, never
whilst riding through a gate to let our guns get athwart-ship. The
morning turned out so dreadfully wet that, after remaining for hours
in a hovel at the foot of the Galtee Mountains, we were forced to
return home. The following day we made a fresh start. Being
sadly in want of dogs, we took out a young pointer who had never
seen a bird, but was tolerably <i>au fait</i> in the initiatory lessons which
I have described. In a short time he began to hunt,&mdash;made several
points in the course of the day,&mdash;and though <i>every</i> thing was strange
to him, &#40;for it was the first time he had been associated in the field
with other dogs,&mdash;nay, almost the first time of his being hunted at
all,&#41; yet, from his comprehension of the several orders that he
received, and perfect obedience, he acquitted himself so creditably,
that he was allowed, not only to be one of the best, but nearly the
very best <i>broken</i> dog of the party. Indeed, the sportsmen who accompanied
the owner &#40;for three guns shot together&mdash;a mal-arrangement
attributable to accidental circumstances, not choice&#41; could hardly be
persuaded that the dog had not been shot over the latter end of the
preceding season.</span></p>

<p id="para_140">140. I name this instance, and I can vouch for its
truth, not as an example to be followed, for it was most
injudicious to have so soon taken out the youngster
with companions, but to prove to you how much you
can effect by initiatory instruction; indeed, afterwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
you will have little else to do than teach and confirm
your dog in a judicious range,&mdash;his own sagacity and
increasing experience will be his principal guides,&mdash;for,
consider how much you will have taught him.</p>

<div class="pageheader">RULES KNOWN.</div>

<p id="para_141">141. He will know&mdash;</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>I</small>.&nbsp;</span>That he is to pay attention to his whistle,&mdash;the
whistle that you design always to use to him.
I mean that, when he hears <i>one</i> low blast on his
whistle he is to look to you for orders, but not
necessarily run towards you, unless he is out of
sight, or you continue whistling &#40;<a href="#para_19">19</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>II</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Toho,&#8221; or the right arm raised nearly perpendicularly,
means that he is to stand still &#40;<a href="#para_19">19</a> to <a href="#para_22">22</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>III</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Drop,&#8221; or the left arm raised nearly perpendicularly,
or the report of a gun, means that he
is to crouch down with his head close to the
ground, between his feet, however far off he may
be ranging. Greater relaxation in the position
may be permitted after he has been a little time
shot over &#40;<a href="#para_23">23</a> to <a href="#para_27">27</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2" id="para_141_IV"><span class="indentnum"><small>IV</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;On,&#8221; &#40;the short word for &#8220;hie on&#8221;,&#41; or the
forward underhand swing of the right hand,
signifies that he is to advance in a forward
direction &#40;the direction in which you are waving&#41;.
This signal is very useful. It implies that you
want the dog to hunt ahead of you. You employ
it also when you are alongside of him at
his point, and are desirous of urging him to
follow up the running bird or birds, and press
to a rise. If he push on too eagerly, you restrain
him by slightly raising the right hand&mdash;<a href="#para_141_XII"><span class="smaller">XII</span></a>. of
this paragraph &#40;<a href="#para_19">19</a> to <a href="#para_22">22</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>V</small>.&nbsp;</span>That a wave of the right arm and hand &#40;the arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
being fully extended and well to the right&#41; from
left to right, means that he is to hunt to the right.
Some men wave the left hand across the body from
left to right, as a direction to the dog to hunt to
the right; but that signal is not so apparent at
a distance as the one I have described &#40;<a href="#para_36">36</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>VI</small>.&nbsp;</span>That a wave of the left arm from right to left &#40;the

<p class="hangingindent2" id="para_141_VII"><span class="indentnum"><small>VII</small>.&nbsp;</span>That the &#8220;Beckon,&#8221; the wave of the right hand
towards you, indicates that he is to hunt towards
you &#40;<a href="#para_37">37</a>&#41;. See also <a href="#para_71">71</a>.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2" id="para_141_VIII"><span class="indentnum"><small>VIII</small>.&nbsp;</span>That the word &#8220;Heel,&#8221; or a wave of the right hand
to the rear &#40;the reverse of the underhand cricket-bowler&#8217;s
swing&#41;, implies that he is to give up
hunting, and go directly close to your heels &#40;<a href="#para_44">44</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>IX</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Fence&#8221; means that he is not to leave the
place where you are. After being so checked a
few times when he is endeavouring to quit the
field, he will understand the word to be an order
not to &#8220;break fence&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_46">46</a>, <a href="#para_47">47</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2" id="para_141_X"><span class="indentnum"><small>X</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Find,&#8221; or &#8220;Seek,&#8221; means that he is to
search for something which he will have great
gratification in discovering. When he is in the
field he will quickly understand this to be game
&#40;<a href="#para_34">34</a>, <a href="#para_35">35</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2" id="para_141_XI"><span class="indentnum"><small>XI</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Dead&#8221; &#40;which it would be well to accompany
with the signal to &#8220;Heel&#8221;&#41; means that
there is something not far off, which he would
have great satisfaction in finding. On hearing
it, he will come to you, and await your signals
instructing him in what direction he is to hunt
for it. When, by signals, you have put him as
near as you can upon the spot where you think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the bird has fallen, you will say, &#8220;Find;&#8221; for,
until you say that word, he ought to be more
occupied in attending to your signals than in
searching for the bird. When you have shot a
good many birds to him, if he is within sight, in
order to work more silently, omit saying &#8220;Dead,&#8221;
only signal to him to go to &#8220;Heel&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_19">19</a>, <a href="#para_34">34</a>, <a href="#para_35">35</a>,

<p class="hangingindent2" id="para_141_XII"><span class="indentnum"><small>XII</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Care&#8221; means that he is near that for which
he is hunting. This word, used with the right
hand slightly raised &#40;the signal for the &#8220;Toho,&#8221;
only not exhibited nearly so energetically&#41;, will
soon make him comprehend that game is near
him, and that he is therefore to hunt cautiously.
You will use it when your young dog is racing
too fast among turnips or potatoes &#40;<a href="#para_39">39</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>XIII</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Up&#8221; means that he is to sniff with his
nose high in the air for that of which he is in
search &#40;<a href="#para_41">41</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>XIV</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Away&#8221; &#40;or &#8220;Gone,&#8221; or &#8220;Flown&#8221;&#41; is an
indication that the thing for which he was hunting,
and of which he smells the taint, is no
longer there. This word is not to be used in
the field until your young dog has gained some
experience &#40;<a href="#para_45">45</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>XV</small>.&nbsp;</span>That &#8220;Ware&#8221; &#40;pronounced &#8220;War&#8221;&#41; is a general
order to desist from whatever he may be doing.
&#8220;No&#8221; is perhaps a better word: it can be pronounced
more distinctly and energetically. If
the command is occasionally accompanied with
the cracking of your whip, its meaning will soon
be understood &#40;<a href="#para_47">47</a>&#41;.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><span class="indentnum"><small>XVI</small>.&nbsp;</span>He will also know the distinction between the

&#8220;Good;&#8221; and, moreover, be sensible, from your
look and manner, whether you are pleased or
angry with him. Dogs, like children, are physiognomists

<div class="pageheader">SHEPHERD&#8217;S DOG.</div>

<p id="para_143"><span class="small">143. By often and uniformly employing the signals I have named,
you will find it more easy to place your pupil, and make him hunt
<i>exactly</i> where you wish, than you may at first suppose. In an open
country the movements of sheep are entirely controlled by dogs; and
if you never have had the opportunity of observing it, you would be
no less surprised than interested at witnessing with what accuracy
a shepherd, standing on a hill side, can, by the motions of his hand
and arm, direct his dog to distant points in the valley below. If
you could see it, you would be satisfied it was not by harsh means
that he obtained such willing, cheerful obedience. His signals to
the right, left, and inwards, are very similar to those just described.
He, however, instructs his dog to go further ahead, by using his
hand and arm as in the action of throwing, but keeping an open
palm towards the animal &#40;the arm raised high&#41;: a signal undeniably
more visible at a distance than the one named in </span><span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_IV">iv</a>.</span><span class="small"> of 141,
though not generally so well suited to the sportsman.</span></p>

<p id="para_144">144. You will also observe, that when the voice is
employed &#40;and this should be done only when the dog
will not obey your signals&#41;, I have recommended you to
make use of but <i>one</i> word. Why should you say,
&#8220;Come to heel,&#8221; &#8220;Ware breaking fence,&#8221; &#8220;Have a care?&#8221;
If you speak in sentences, you may at times unconsciously
vary the words of the sentence, or the emphasis
on any word; and as it is only by the sound that you
should expect a dog to be guided, the more defined and
distinct in sound the several commands are, the better.</p>

<div class="pageheader">NAMES DISSIMILAR IN SOUND.</div>

<p id="para_145">145. This consideration leads to the remark that, as,
by nearly universal consent, &#8220;Toho&#8221; is the word employed
to tell a dog to point, the old rule is clearly a
judicious one, never to call him &#8220;Ponto,&#8221; &#8220;Sancho,&#8221; or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
by any name ending in &#8220;o.&#8221; Always, too, choose one
that can be hallooed in a sharp, loud, high key. You
will find the advantage of this whenever you lose your
dog, and happen not to have a whistle. Observe, also,
if you have several dogs, to let their names be dissimilar
in sound.</p>

<p id="para_146">146. I have suggested your employing the word
&#8220;Drop,&#8221; instead of the usual word &#8220;Down,&#8221; because it
is less likely to be uttered by any one on whom the dog
might jump or fawn; for, on principle, I strongly object
to any order being given which is not strictly enforced.
It begets in a dog, as much as in the nobler animal who
walks on two legs, habits of inattention to words of
command, and ultimately makes greater severity necessary.
If I felt certain I should never wish to part with
a dog I was instructing, I should carry this principle so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
far as to frame a novel vocabulary, and never use any
word I thought he would be likely to hear from others.
By-the-bye, whenever you purchase a dog, it would be
advisable to ascertain what words of command, and
what signals he has been accustomed to.</p>

<p id="para_148"><span class="small">148. If a lady takes a dog out for a walk, she keeps constantly
calling to it, lest it should go astray and be lost. The result is, that
ere long, the dog pays not the slightest attention to her, his own
sagacity telling him that he need not trouble himself to watch her,
as she will be sure to look after him. But she can plead a charming
authority for her weakness,&mdash;Charles Lamb&mdash;who felt obliged to

<p id="para_149"><span class="small">149. There is also a varying in the manner, tone of voice, and
words of command, which generally prevents the success of ladies
in teaching a four-footed pet any tricks beyond the art of begging.
This feat they accomplish because they cannot well deviate from the
beaten path. They naturally hold the animal in a proper position
while they say, &#8220;Beg; beg, sir, beg;&#8221; and do not give him the
reward until he has obeyed orders more or less satisfactorily.</span></p>

seldom lose anything in their walks, as their faithful companion
would almost invariably be on the alert to pick up and carry to
them whatever they might drop. It is in this manner that dogs
are sometimes made very useful assistants at cricket. A golf-ball
maker at St. Andrew&#8217;s, <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span> <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, employs his dog yet more
usefully&mdash;at least more profitably. He has taught the animal to
search the links by himself for balls, and to take home all he finds.
Until the introduction of the universally applied gutta percha, the
price of golf-balls was two shillings each. It may, therefore, be
easily imagined that the diligent little fellow paid liberally for his
board and lodging. But the trick of carrying has been made as
serviceable to the dog as to his master.</span></p>

<p id="para_151"><span class="small">151. A cousin of one of my brother officers, Colonel <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, was
taking a walk in the year &#8217;49, at Tonbridge Wells, when a strange
Newfoundland made a snatch at the parasol she held loosely in her
hand, and quietly carried it off. His jaunty air and wagging tail
plainly told, as he marched along, that he was much pleased at his
feat. The lady civilly requested him to restore it. This he declined,
but in so gracious a manner, that she essayed, though ineffectually,
to drag it from him. She therefore laughingly, albeit unwillingly,
was constrained to follow her property rather than abandon it altogether.
The dog kept ahead, constantly looking round to see if
she followed, and was evidently greatly pleased at perceiving that
she continued to favour him with her company. At length, he
stepped into a confectioner&#8217;s, where the lady renewed her attempts
to obtain possession of her property; but as the Newfoundland
would not resign it, she applied to the shopman for assistance, who
said that it was an old trick of the dog&#8217;s to get a bun; that if she
would give him one, he would immediately return the stolen goods.
She cheerfully did so, and the dog as willingly made the exchange.</span></p>

<p id="para_153">153. &#8220;Carrying&#8221; is a pretty&mdash;occasionally, as we see,
a useful&mdash;trick, but it does not further any sporting
object. &#8220;Carrying&#8221; and &#8220;fetching&#8221; are essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
different. The object chiefly sought in the latter is to
make the dog deliver <i>expeditiously</i> &#40;<a href="#para_107">107</a>&#41;,&mdash;in the former,
to make him carry <i>perseveringly</i> for miles and miles.
To inculcate carrying, always make him suppose that
you greatly regard what is confided to his charge.
Many a good carrier is spoiled by children picking
up any stick and giving it to him. He has the sense
to know that it is valueless, and when he is tired of the
fun, he drops it <i>unrebuked</i>, and, after a time, is supplied
with another. If you practise a pup in carrying a stick,
show more discretion than to let it be so long that it
must jar against his teeth by trailing on the ground, or
hitting the walls.</p>

<p id="para_154"><span class="small">154. Being on the subject of tricks, as several ladies have done
me the unexpected but highly appreciated honour of reading what
I have said respecting their four-footed attendants, I think it as
well to observe, should they be tempted to teach a favourite any
accomplishments, that these should be practised occasionally, or
they may be forgotten, &#40;all the sooner, like more serious studies, the
more easily they were acquired;&#41; and that the exhibition of them
might be made much more effective and striking by a little exercise,
on the ladies&#8217; part, of the address and tact with which Dame
Nature has so liberally endowed them.</span></p>

<p id="para_155"><span class="small">155. Quite a sensation was created many years ago, at Tonbridge
Wells, by the Hon. C. <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;s</span>, who possessed a dog which had been
taught by a former master, for very unlawful purposes, to fetch,
when ordered, any article to which his owner had slily directed the
animal&#8217;s attention.</span></p>

<p id="para_156"><span class="small">156. The gentleman was walking up and down the crowded
Pantiles, listening to the public band, and playing the agreeable to
a titled lady, whom he subsequently married; when, bowing to
some passing acquaintance, he casually observed, &#8220;How badly my
hat has been brushed!&#8221; at the same time giving the private signal
to the dog, who instantly ran off to one of the adjacent toy-shops,
and brought away the hat-brush which his master had pointed out
to him about a quarter of an hour before.</span></p>

<p id="para_157"><span class="small">157. As Mr. <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;s</span> kept his own counsel, the lady and many of
their friends, as well as the pursuing shopman, fancied the dog had
sufficient intelligence to understand what had been said, and had,
from his own sagacity, volunteered fetching what he conceived was
required.</span></p>

<p id="para_158"><span class="small">158. The barrack-rooms at Gibraltar used not to be furnished

while I was there, and, by-the-bye, so good a player at draughts,
that he used to aver&mdash;and his unusual skill seemed to prove the
correctness of the assertion&mdash;that, if he had the first move, he
could win to a certainty, was accustomed to summon his servant by
sending his dog for him. On getting the signal, away the Maltese
poodle would go, not much impeded by closed doors in that hot
climate, and, by a bark, inform the man that he was wanted.</span></p>

<p id="para_159"><span class="small">159. The daily routine of a quiet bachelor&#8217;s life is so unvaried in

<p id="para_160"><span class="small">160. But for exhibiting tricks with effect doubtless my old warm-hearted
friend <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, &#40;elsewhere mentioned <a href="#para_450">450</a>,&#41; bears off the
palm. He brought two young elephants to England from Ceylon;
one he secured when it was a mere baby, and would not quit the
side of its dam after he had shot her. The other was about seven
feet high. He had taught them several tricks before they embarked,
and during the long voyage home, passed on deck, they
had learned many others from the sailors, and, when needed, would
usefully help in giving &#8220;a long pull,&mdash;a strong pull,&mdash;and a pull all
together.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_161"><span class="small">161. General <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;g</span> having spoken to the Duchess of <span class="glue">Y&mdash;&mdash;k</span>

possess the smallest; of course <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> was too gallant a man not
to send it at once to Oatlands. George the Fourth heard of the
other; and on some of his staff mentioning that it would be acceptable
to His Majesty, it went to the Pavilion at Brighton. It was kept
there until they were tired of it, when it was transferred to the
Tower. Hearing of its being there, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> one morning went into
the menagerie. An officer of the Guards, on duty at the Tower,
was at the moment seeing the animals with a party of ladies;
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> was in a hurry, and inquired where the elephant was,
saying he had come expressly to have a look at him and nothing
else. The officer very good-humouredly observed that it mattered
not what beasts they saw first, so the party adjourned to the
elephant. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> urged the keeper to go into the den to show
him off, but the man said the animal had so recently arrived there
that he was afraid. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> offered to go in. The man refused
leave, stating it was more than his situation was worth to permit it.
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> pressed to be allowed. The officer warmly urged the
keeper to comply, &#8220;as the gentleman felt so confident,&#8221; and the
keeper wavering, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, without saying another word, squeezed
himself through the massive oak bars, went up boldly to the
elephant, put his hand on his shoulder as he used to do in old
days; the sagacious brute at once obeyed the signal and lay down,
got up again when desired, salaamed to the ladies, held a foot out
for <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> to stand on, then raised it up to aid <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> in getting
on his back, and afterwards lay down to enable his old master to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
dismount conveniently. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> then tickled him to make him
kick, which the awkward looking beast did in a very laughable
manner, and the laugh of the spectators was not diminished
by his squeezing <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> so close into a corner, that he could only
escape by slipping under the creature&#8217;s belly. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> finished
the exhibition by making him turn round, and again salaam the
company.</span></p>

<p id="para_162"><span class="small">162. I will not swear that <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, who has much quiet humour,
did not propose going into any other den and show off all the lions
and tigers in a similar manner, but he found, of course unexpectedly,
on looking at his watch, that he was obliged to hurry off instantly.
The delighted and bewildered keeper entreated him to reveal the
secret by which such marvellous feats were performed. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>
promised to do so on his return to London; and he would have
kept his word, had not the poor elephant soon afterwards died in
cutting his tusks. So the man to this day, for all I know to the
contrary, thinks my friend little less than a necromancer.</span></p>

<p id="para_163"><span class="small">163. It is to be observed that ladies&#8217; dogs are generally so pampered
and overfed that a common reward does not stimulate them
to exertion in the same degree it does dogs less favoured. I should

health, high spirits, and keen appetite of the latter, a fair set-off
against the delicacies and caresses bestowed by the prettiest and
most indulgent of mistresses. Though the collie is the shepherd&#8217;s
constant companion, the shepherd well knows that always petting
the dog would spoil him. Sir <span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, a Highlander,
observed to his gamekeeper, that he never saw the shepherds
coaxing and caressing their collies. &#8220;True,&#8221; the man replied,
&#8220;but you never saw one strike his dog; he is always kind to them.&#8221;
Hear this, ye ladies, who would be right glad that your pretty pets
were a hundred times more obedient than you find them.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">TROUT TAMED.</div>

<p id="para_164"><span class="small">164. There are few animals whose confidence, if not attachment,
may not be gained by constant kindness without petting. One
summer&#8217;s morning I walked from Ross to breakfast with Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;s</span>
at his picturesque old-fashioned house, built near a small tributary
to the Wye. I was specially invited to see some tame trout, whose
timidity Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;s</span> had overcome by feeding them regularly every
day. Until he made his appearance near the waters, not a fish was
visible; and it was very interesting to watch the perfect confidence
they evinced, I might add pleasure, whenever he approached the
banks. He said he felt sure he could get them to feed out of his
hands, if he chose to devote sufficient time to them. There was
one fine fellow for whom all the rest most respectfully made way.
He weighed close upon 5 lbs. This was proved; for a party,
whose name I dare not mention, secretly caught the animal in order
to weigh it, and though he immediately replaced it in the water
perfectly uninjured, yet its old distrust was so much re-awakened
that it hid itself for four or five months. Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;s</span> naturally
thought that it had been captured by some poacher, and had met
with the same unlucky fate as a former favourite, of still larger
dimensions, which a newly-hired cook had contrived to secure
whilst it was basking in the shallows; and had served up at dinner-time,
in the full expectation of receiving much commendation for
her piscatory skill.</span></p>

<p id="para_165"><span class="small">165. Judicious perseverance,&mdash;in other words, consistency,&mdash;will
not only teach accomplishments, but correct bad manners. The
oldest friend I possess used to allow a favourite dog to sleep in his
bed-room. The animal, though he had a very short, clean coat, was
always more or less annoyed by those nimblest of tormentors<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to

be found in most countries, particularly in warm ones; and there
being no carpet in the room, his scratching at night, as you may
well imagine, made a loud, disagreeable thumping against the
boards, which <i>invariably</i> awoke my friend &#40;a very light sleeper&#41;,
and he as <i>invariably</i> scolded the dog. This undeviating consistency
made the dog at length entirely relinquish the obnoxious practice,
until his master was fairly awake, or at least had begun to stretch
and yawn.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">JUDICIOUS PERSEVERANCE.</div>

<p id="para_166"><span class="small">166. Now, I want you to observe, that had the noise but only
<i>occasionally</i> awakened my friend, however much he might then
have scolded, the dog would not have given up the habit; he
would constantly have entertained the hope that he might endeavour
to remove his tiny persecutors unreproved, and the temptation
would have outweighed the risk. It would have been inconsistent
to have frequently but not always checked him. I know a lady,
possessing great perseverance and temper, who has taught even cats
many tricks&mdash;nay, since the last edition of this book was printed I
have heard of several ladies having most successfully educated dogs
for the field. A very pleasant girl, Miss <span class="glue">G&mdash;&mdash;h</span>, almost a stranger
to me, who sat next to me at a large dinner-party about a year ago,
asked me in the course of conversation whether I was related to the
author of &#8220;Dog-Breaking,&#8221;&mdash;and then greatly gratified me by saying
that her sister had broken in several Pointers for her brother, a
M.F.H. She spoke of one particular 1st of September, when her
sister was rather nervous as a well-known keen sportsman had been
invited to shoot, and a young well-bred dog, solely tutored by
herself, was to bear his first shot&mdash;but at dinner-time she was amply
recompensed for all the trouble she had taken by having the delight
of learning that her pupil had performed admirably, and had understood
and been attentive to every signal. I asked how it was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the youngster was not alarmed at the report of the gun. She
replied that it was doubtless attributable to his perfect confidence
that he should not be hurt, as he had never undergone any punishing
during the whole course of his training.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">WIN AFFECTION.</div>

<p id="para_167"><span class="small">167. Ladies&#8217; pets are a proof that dogs can, as easily as children,
be effectually spoiled by injudicious kindness; but canine nature
contrasts with infant nature in this, that no petting or spoiling will
withdraw a dog&#8217;s affection from the individual to whom he first
becomes attached in a new home, provided that person continues
but decently civil to him. And be this a caution to you. If ever
you have a stranger to instruct, let no one but yourself associate
with or feed him for many days after his arrival. You may then
feel assured of afterwards possessing his unrivalled affections,
especially if to you alone he is to be grateful for his enjoyment in
the field; and you must win his affection, or he will not strive to
his utmost to assist you.</span></p>

<p id="para_168"><span class="small">168. A well-known poaching character,&mdash;though ostensibly, and
by <i>profession</i>, a dog-breaker,&mdash;was remarkable for the fondness
immediately evinced for him by all dogs placed under his care. He
was not particular about his dress; and it at length transpired that
it was his custom to make up a bed, for all new comers, in his room,
of the clothes he had just taken off. This so habituated the dogs
to the scent of his person, by night as well as by day, that they
became unwilling to quit it, especially as the man was naturally
good-tempered, and always treated them with great kindness.</span></p>

<p id="para_169"><span class="small">169. Captain Parry relates of the Esquimaux dogs, that they are
far more attached,&mdash;from kindnesses received in youth,&mdash;to the
women, than to the men; and that, consequently, the latter, in all
cases of difficulty, are obliged to apply to their wives to catch the
almost woolly animals, and coax them to draw unusually heavy
loads. The beloved voice of the women will control and animate
the dogs to exertion, at a time when the words of the men would
be powerless, and their blows only produce irritation or obstinacy.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;BREAKING&#8221; IN PAIRING SEASON.</div>

<p id="para_170">170. A keeper nearly always breaks in his young
dogs to point, &#40;or &#8220;set&#8221; as some term it&#41; if their ages
permit it, on favourable days in Spring, when the partridges
have paired.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He gets plenty of points, and
the birds lie well. But I cannot believe it is the best
way to attain great excellence, though the plan has
many followers: it does not cultivate the intelligence
of his pupils, nor enlarge their ideas by making them
sensible of the object for which such pains are taken in
hunting them. Moreover, their natural ardour &#40;a feeling
that it should be his aim rather to increase than weaken&#41;
is more or less damped by having often to stand at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
game, before they can be rewarded for their exertions
by having it killed to them,&mdash;it prevents, rather than
imparts, the zeal and perseverance for which Irish dogs
are so remarkable &#40;<a href="#para_565">565</a>&#41;. Particularly ought a breaker,
whose pupil is of a nervous temperament, or of too
gentle a disposition, to consider well that the want of
all recompense for finding paired birds, must make
a timid dog far more likely to become a &#8220;blinker,&#8221;
when he is checked for not pointing them, than when
he is checked for not pointing birds, which his own
impetuosity alone deprives him of every chance of
rapturously &#8220;touseling.&#8221; &#40;See also end of <a href="#para_280">280</a>.&#41; The
very fact that &#8220;the birds lie well&#8221; frequently leads to
mischief; for, if the instructor be not very watchful,
there is a fear that his youngsters may succeed in
getting too close to their game before he forces them
to come to a stanch point. A keeper, however, has
but little choice, &#40;and it is not a bad time to teach
the back,&#41; if his master insist upon shooting over the
animals the first day of the season, and expect to find
them what some call &#8220;perfectly broken in.&#8221; But
I trust some few of my readers may have nobler
ends in view, and that they will cheerfully sacrifice
a little of their shooting the first week of the season, to
ensure super-excellence in their pupils at its close. Remember,
I do not object to spring drilling, &#40;vide <a href="#para_131">131</a>&#41;
but to much spring pointing.</p>

<p id="para_171">171. I will suppose your youngster to have been well
grounded in his initiatory lessons, and that you take
him out when the crops are nearly off the ground &#40;by
which time there will be few squeakers&#41; on a fine cool
day in September, &#40;alas! that it cannot be an August
day on the moors,&#41; to show him birds for the first time.
As he is assumed to be highly-bred, you may start in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the confident expectation of killing partridges over him,
especially if he be a pointer. Have his nose moist and
healthy. Take him out when the birds are on the feed,
and of an afternoon in preference to the morning,
&#40;unless from an unusually dry season there be but little
scent,&#41; that he may not be attracted by the taint of
hares or rabbits. Take him out alone, if he evince any
disposition to hunt, which, at the age we will presume
him to have attained this season, we must assume
that he will do, and with great zeal. Be much guided
by his temper and character. Should he possess great
courage and dash, you cannot begin too soon to make
him point. You should always check a wild dog in
racing after pigeons and small birds on their rising;
whereas you should encourage a timid dog &#40;one who
clings to &#8220;heel&#8221;&#41; in such a fruitless but exciting chase.
The measures to be pursued with such an animal are
fully detailed in <a href="#para_132">132</a>, <a href="#para_133">133</a>.</p>

<div class="pageheader">CONSTANT LOW WHISTLE INJUDICIOUS.</div>

<p id="para_172">172. I may as well caution you against adopting the
foolish practice of attempting to cheer on your dog with
a constant low whistle, under the mistaken idea that it
will animate him to increased zeal in hunting. From
perpetually hearing the monotonous sound, it would
prove as little of an incentive to exertion as a continued
chirrup to a horse; and yet if habituated to it, your
dog would greatly miss it whenever hunted by a stranger.
Not unregarded, however, would it be by the
birds, to whom on a calm day it would act as a very
salutary warning.</p>

<p id="para_173">173. Though you have not moors, fortunately we can
suppose your fields to be of a good size. Avoid all
which have been recently manured. Select those that
are large, and in which you are the least likely to find
birds until his spirits are somewhat sobered, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
begins partly to comprehend your instructions respecting
his range. There is no reason why he should not
have been taken out a few days before this, <i>not to show
him birds</i>, but to have commenced teaching him how to
traverse his ground. Indeed, if we had supposed him
of a sufficient age &#40;<a href="#para_132">132</a>&#41;, he might by this time be somewhat
advanced towards a systematic beat. It is seeing
many birds early that is to be deprecated, not his being
taught how to range.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SCENT INEXPLICABLE.</div>

<p id="para_174">174. <i>Be careful to enter every field at the leeward</i><a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
side &#40;about the middle&#41;, that he may have the wind to
work against. Choose a day when there is a breeze,
but not a boisterous one. In a calm, the scent is stationary,
and can hardly be found unless accidentally.
In a gale it is scattered to the four quarters.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
want not an undirected ramble, but a judicious traversing
beat under your own guidance, which shall
leave no ground unexplored, and yet have none twice
explored.</p>

<div class="pageheader">INSTRUCTIONS IN RANGING.</div>

<p id="para_175">175. Suppose the form of the field, as is usually the
case, to approach a parallelogram or square, and that
the wind blows in any direction but diagonally across
it. On entering at the leeward side send the dog from
you by a wave of your hand or the word &#8220;On.&#8221; You
wish him, while you are advancing up the middle of it,
to cross you at right angles, say from right to left,&mdash;then
to run up wind for a little, parallel to your own direction,
and afterwards to re-cross in front of you from
left to right, and so on until the whole field is regularly
hunted. To effect this, notwithstanding your previous
preparatory lessons, you will have to show him the way,
as it were &#40;setting him an example in your own person&#41;,
by running a few steps in the direction you wish him to
go &#40;say to the right&#41;, cheering him on to take the lead.
As he gets near the extremity of his beat, when he does
not observe you, you can steal a small advance in the
true direction of your own beat, which is directly up
the middle of the field, meeting the wind. If perceiving
your advance he turns towards you, face him,&mdash;wave
your right hand to him, and while he sees you,
run on a few paces in his direction &#40;that is <i>parallel</i> to
his true direction&#41;. As he approaches the hedge &#40;the
one on your right hand, but be careful that he does not
get close to it, lest, from often finding game there, he
ultimately become a potterer and regular hedge-hunter&#41;
face towards him, and on catching his eye, wave your
left arm. If you cannot succeed in catching his
eye, you must give one low whistle,&mdash;the less you
habituate yourself to use the whistle, the less you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
will alarm the birds,&mdash;study to do all, as far as is
practicable, by signals. You wish your wave of the
left arm to make the dog turn to the left &#40;his head
to the wind&#41;, and that he should run parallel to the side
of the hedge for some yards &#40;say from thirty to forty&#41;
before he makes his second turn to the left to cross the
field; but you must expect him to turn too directly
towards you on your first signal to turn. Should he
by any rare chance have made the turn &#40;the first one&#41;
correctly, and thus be hunting up wind, on no account
interrupt him by making any signals until he has run
up the distance you wish, &#40;the aforesaid thirty or forty
yards,&#41;&mdash;then again catch his eye, and, as before &#40;not
now, however, faced towards him and the hedge, but
faced towards your true direction&#41;, by a wave of the
left arm endeavour to make him turn to the left &#40;across
the wind&#41;. If, contrary to what you have a right to
suppose, he will not turn towards you on your giving a
whistle and wave of your hand, stand still, and continue
whistling&mdash;eventually he will obey. But you must not
indulge in the faintest hope that all I have described
will be done correctly; be satisfied at first with an
approach towards accuracy; you will daily find an
improvement, if you persevere steadily. When you
see that there is but little chance of his turning the
way you want, at once use the signal more consonant
to his views, for it should be your constant endeavour
to make him fancy that he is always ranging according
to the directions of your hands. Be particular in attending
to this hint.</p>

<p id="para_176">176. His past tuition &#40;<a href="#para_38">38</a>&#41; most probably will have
accustomed him to watch your eye for directions, therefore
it is not likely, even should he have made a wrong
turn near the hedge &#40;a turn down wind instead of up wind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which would wholly have prevented the required
advance parallel to the hedge&#41;, that he will cross in rear
of you. Should he, however, do so, retreat a few steps,
&#40;or face about if he is far in the rear,&#41; in order to impress
him with the feeling that all his work must be
performed under your eye. Animate him with an
encouraging word as he passes. When he gets near
the hedge to the left, endeavour, by signals &#40;agreeably
to the method just explained&#41; &#40;<a href="#para_175">175</a>&#41;, to make him turn
to the &#40;his&#41; right, his head to the wind, and run up
alongside of it for the thirty to forty yards, if you can
manage it, before he begins to re-cross the field, by
making a second turn to the right. If you could get
him to do this, he would cross well in advance of you.</p>

<p id="para_177">177. Though most likely his turn &#40;the first&mdash;the turn
up wind&#41; will be too abrupt &#40;too much of an acute
angle instead of the required right angle&#41;, and that
consequently, in order to get ahead of you, he will have
to traverse the field diagonally, yet after a few trials
it is probable he will do so, rather than not get in front
of you. This would be better than the former attempt
&#40;not obliging you to face about&#41;,&mdash;express your approval,
and the next turn near the hedge may be made with a
bolder sweep. Remember your aim is, that no part be
unhunted, and that none once commanded by his nose
be again hunted. He ought to cross, say thirty yards
in front of you, but <i>much</i> will depend upon his nose.</p>

<div class="pageheader">TO WATCH FOR SIGNALS.</div>

<p id="para_178">178. Nearly on every occasion of catching his eye,
except when he is running up wind parallel to the hedge,
give him some kind of signal. This will more and more
confirm him in the habit of looking to you, from time to
time, for orders, and thus aid in insuring his constant
obedience. After a while, judging by the way in which
your face is turned, he will know in what direction you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
purpose advancing, and will guide his own movements
accordingly. Should he, as most probably he will for
some time, turn too sharply towards you when getting
near the hedge, I mean at too acute an angle, incline or
rather face towards him. This, coupled with the natural
wish to range unrestrained, will make him hunt longer
parallel to the hedge, before he makes his second turn
towards you.</p>

<p id="para_179">179. You may at first strive to correct your dog&#8217;s
turning too abruptly inwards &#40;the first turn&#41;, by pushing
on in your own person further ahead on your own beat;
but when he has acquired if merely the slightest idea of
a correct range, be most careful not to get in advance of
the ground he is to hunt. Your doing so might habituate
him to cross the field diagonally &#40;thereby leaving much
of the sides of the fields unhunted&#41;, in order to get
ahead of you; and, moreover, <i>you</i> might spring birds
which you are anxious <i>he</i> should find. Should he, on
the other hand, be inclined to work too far upward
before making his turn to cross the field, hang back
in your own person.</p>

<div class="pageheader">RANGE GREATER ON MOORS.</div>

<p id="para_180">180. Though you may be in an unenclosed country,
let him range at first from no more than from seventy to
eighty yards on each side of you. You can gradually
extend these lateral beats as he becomes conversant
with his business&mdash;indeed, at the commencement, rather
diminish than increase the distances just named, both
for the length of the parallels and the space between
them. Do not allow the alluring title &#8220;a fine wide
ranger&#8221; to tempt you to let him out of leading-strings.
If he be once permitted to imagine that he has a discretionary
power respecting the best places to hunt, and
the direction and length of his beats, you will find it
extremely difficult to get him again well in hand. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the moors his range must be far greater than on the
stubbles, but still the rudiments must be taught on this
contracted scale, or you will never get him to look to
you for orders. Do <i>you</i> keep entire control over his
beats; let <i>him</i> have almost the sole management of his
drawing upon birds, provided he does not puzzle, or run
riot too long over an old haunt. Give him time, and
after a little experience his nose will tell him more
surely than your judgment can, whether he is working
on the &#8220;toe&#8221; or &#8220;heel&#8221; of birds, and, whether he
diverges from or approaches the strongest and most
recent haunt,&mdash;do not flurry or hurry him, and he will
soon acquire that knowledge.</p>

<div class="pageheader">POWERS OF SCENT VARY.</div>

<p id="para_181">181. As the powers of scent vary greatly in different
dogs, the depth of their turns &#40;or parallels&#41; ought to
vary also, and it will be hereafter for you to judge what
distance between the parallels it is most advantageous
for your youngster ultimately to adopt in his general
hunting. The deeper his turns are, of course, the more
ground you will beat within a specified time. What
you have to guard against is the possibility of their
being so wide that birds may be passed by unnoticed. I
should not like to name the distance within which good
<i>cautious</i> dogs that carry their heads high, will wind
game on a favourable day.</p>

<p id="para_182"><span class="small">182. I was partridge-shooting the season before last with an
intimate friend. The air was soft and there was a good breeze.
We came upon a large turnip-field, deeply trenched on account of
its damp situation. A white setter, that habitually carried a lofty
head, drew for awhile, and then came to a point. We got up to her.
She led us across some ridges, when her companion, a jealous dog
&#40;a pointer&#41;, which had at first backed correctly, most improperly
pushed on in front, but, not being able to acknowledge the scent,
went off, clearly imagining the bitch was in error. She, however,
held on, and in beautiful style brought us direct to a covey. My
friend and I agreed that she must have been but little, if at all, less
than one hundred yards off when she first winded the birds; and it
was clear to us that they could not have been running, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
breeze came directly across the furrows, and she had led us in the
wind&#8217;s eye. We thought the point the more remarkable, as it is
generally supposed that the strong smell of turnips diminishes a
dog&#8217;s power of scenting birds.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SCENT ONE HUNDRED YARDS.</div>

<p id="para_183"><span class="small">183. <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;t</span> <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, a gamekeeper, once assured me he had seen
a point at grouse which were at the least one hundred and fifty
yards off. The dogs were on the edge of a valley&mdash;the pack on a
little hillock from which direction the wind blew&mdash;an intervening
wall near the top of the hillock separated them from the dogs; and
as intermediately there was no heather, the man was satisfied that
the birds had not run over the ground. When I was talking one
day to Mr. <span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, the well-known gunmaker in the Haymarket,
about the qualities of dogs&#8217; noses,&mdash;and from his long experience he
ought to be a judge of such matters,&mdash;he told me, before I had said
a word respecting distances, that he thought he had seen more than
once a dog point at one hundred and fifty yards from his game.</span></p>

<p id="para_184">184. If you design your pupil, when broken in, to
hunt with a companion, and wish both the dogs, as is
usual, to cross you, you will, of course, habituate him to
make his sweeps &#40;the space between the parallels&#41; wider
than if you had intended him to hunt without any one
to share his labours.</p>

<p id="para_185">185. I need hardly warn you to be careful not to
interrupt him whenever he appears to be winding birds.
However good his nose may be by nature, it will not
gain experience and discrimination, unless you give him
a certain time to determine for himself whether he has
really touched upon a faint scent of birds, and whether
they are in his front or rear, or gone away altogether. Like
every other faculty, his sense of smell will improve the
more it is exercised. But on the other hand, as I
observed before, do not let him continue puzzling with
his nose close to the ground,&mdash;urge him on,&mdash;make him
increase his pace,&mdash;force him to search elsewhere, and
he will gradually elevate his head, and catching the
scent of other particles, will follow up these with a nose
borne aloft, unless he is a brute not worth a twentieth
part of the pains which you think of bestowing upon
him; for,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p id="para_186">186. Besides the greatly decreased chance of finding
them, birds that to a certainty would become uneasy,
and make off if pursued by a dog tracking them, will
often lie well to one who finds them by the wind. They
are then not aware that they are discovered, and the
dog, from the information his nose gives him, can
approach them either boldly or with great wariness,
according as he perceives them to be more or less shy.</p>

<div class="pageheader">FIND BY WIND.&mdash;WHITE DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_187"><span class="small">187. It is rather foreign to our immediate subject, but I will here
observe, that it is generally thought white dogs cannot approach
shy birds<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> as closely as dogs of a dark colour can &#40;<a href="#para_93">93</a>&#41;; but there
is a set-off to this supposed disadvantage in <i>your</i> being able to
distinguish the light ones more readily at a distance,&mdash;a matter of
some moment on heather. If you have not your eye on a steady
brown setter at the moment he drops on grouse, you may spend half
an hour most vexatiously in searching for him. When you expect
to find the birds wild, should your kennel allow you the choice, you
ought to take out those of a sombre hue. Light coloured dogs
have not generally such well-shaped feet as their darker brethren.
It is curious that white feet in dogs as well as in horses should often
be objectionable. As a rule, setters have harder, tougher feet than
pointers. This is very apparent in a flinty country or in frosty
weather, and is partly attributable to their being better defended
with hair round the ball, and between the toes.</span></p>

<p id="para_188">188. If, being unable to catch the dog&#8217;s eye, you are
forced to use the whistle frequently, and he continues
inattentive to it, notwithstanding his previous tuition,
stand still,&mdash;make him lie down &#40;by the word &#8220;drop,&#8221; if
he will not obey your raised left arm&#41;&mdash;go up to him,&mdash;take
hold of his collar, and rate him, saying, &#8220;Bad, bad,&#8221;
cracking your whip over him &#40;let the whip be one that
will crack loudly, not for present purposes, but that,
when occasion requires, he may hear it at a distance&#41;
and whistling softly. This will show him &#40;should you

chidden for not paying attention to the whistle. Indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
whenever you have occasion to scold or punish him,
make it a constant rule, while you rate him, to repeat
many times the word of command, or the signal which
he has neglected to obey. There is no other way by
which you will make him understand you <i>quickly</i>.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SYSTEMATIC RANGE.</div>

<p id="para_189">189. You must expect that your young dog will for
some time make sad mistakes in his range;&mdash;but be not
discouraged. Doubtless there is no one thing,&mdash;I was
going to say, that there are no dozen things,&mdash;in the
whole art of dog-breaking, which are so difficult to
attain, or which exact so much labour, as a high, well-confirmed,
systematic range. Nature will not assist
you:&mdash;you must do it all yourself; but in recompense
there is nothing so advantageous when it is at length
acquired. It will abundantly repay months of persevering
exertion. It constitutes the grand criterion of
true excellence. Its attainment makes a dog of inferior
nose and action far superior to one of much greater
natural qualifications who may be tomfooling about,
galloping backwards and forwards sometimes over identically
the same ground, quite uselessly exerting his
travelling powers; now and then, indeed, arrested by
the suspicion of a haunt, which he is not experienced
enough, or sufficiently taught, to turn to good account,&mdash;and
occasionally brought to a stiff point on birds accidentally
found right under his nose. It is undeniable,
<i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, that the dog who hunts his ground most
according to rule must in the end find most game.</p>

<p id="para_190">190. If it is your fixed determination to confirm
your dog in the truly-killing range described in the last
Chapter, do not associate him for months in the field
with another dog, however highly broken. It would be
far better to devote but two hours per diem to your
pupil exclusively, than to hunt him the whole day with
a companion.</p>

<div class="pageheader">OLD DOG LEADER.</div>

<p id="para_191">191. Many breakers do exactly the reverse of this.
They take out an old steady ranger, with the intention
that he shall lead the young dog, and that the latter,
from imitation and habit, shall learn how to quarter his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ground. But what he gains by imitation will so little
improve his intellects, that, when thrown upon his own
resources, he will prove a miserable finder. On a hot,
dry day he will not be able to make out a feather, nor
on any day to &#8220;foot&#8221; a delicate scent. I grant that the
plan expedites matters, and attains the end which <i>most</i>
professional trainers seek; but it will not give a dog
self-confidence and independence, it will not impart to
him an inquiring nose, and make him rely on its sensitiveness
to discover game, rather than to his quickness
of eye to detect when his friend touches upon a haunt;
nor will it instruct him to look from time to time towards
the gun for directions. It may teach him a range,
but not to hunt where he is ordered; nor will it habituate
him to vary the breadth of the parallels on
which he works, according as his master may judge it to
be a good or bad scenting day.</p>

<div class="pageheader">RANGE EASIEST TAUGHT ON MOORS.</div>

<p id="para_192">192. To establish the rare, noble beat I am recommending,&mdash;one
not hereafter to be deranged by the
temptation of a furrow in turnips or potatoes,&mdash;you
must have the philosophy not to hunt your dog in them
until he is accustomed in his range to be guided entirely
by the wind and your signals, and is in no way influenced
by the nature of the ground. Even then it
would be better not to beat narrow strips across which
it would be impossible for him to make his regular
casts. Avoid, too, for some time, if you can, all small
fields &#40;which will only contract his range&#41;, and all fields
with trenches or furrows, for he will but too naturally
follow them instead of paying attention to his true beat.
Have you never, in low lands, seen a young dog running
down a potato or turnip trench, out of which his
master, after much labour, had no sooner extracted him
than he dropped into the adjacent one? It is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
absence of artificial tracks which makes the range of
nearly all dogs <i>well</i> broken on the moors so much truer
than that of dogs hunted on cultivated lands.</p>

<p id="para_193">193. Moreover, in turnips, potatoes, clover, and the
like thick shelter, birds will generally permit a dog to
approach so closely, that if he is much accustomed to
hunt such places, he will be sure to acquire the evil
habit of pressing too near his game when finding on the
stubbles &#40;instead of being startled as it were into an
instantaneous stop the moment he first winds game&#41;,
and thus raise many a bird out of gun-shot that a
<i>cautious</i> dog,&mdash;one who slackens his pace the instant he
judges that he is beating a likely spot,&mdash;would not have
alarmed.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SEARCHING NOSE.</div>

<p id="para_194">194. &#8220;A <i>cautious</i> dog&#8221;! Can there well be a more
flattering epithet?<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Such a dog can hardly travel too
fast<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> in a tolerably open country, where there is not a
superabundance of game, <i>if</i> he really hunt with an
inquiring nose;&mdash;but to his master what an all-important
&#8220;if&#8221; is this! It marks the difference between the sagacious,
wary, patient, yet diligent animal, whose every
sense and every faculty is absorbed in his endeavour to
make out birds, not for himself but for the gun, and the
wild harum-scarum who blunders up three-fourths of
the birds he finds. No! not <i>finds</i>, but frightens,&mdash;for he
is not aware of their presence until they are on the
wing, and seldom points unless he gets some heedless
bird right under his nose, when an ignoramus, in admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the beauty of the dog&#8217;s sudden attitude, will
often forget the mischief which he has done.</p>

<p id="para_195"><span class="small">195. Nature gives this caution to some dogs at an early age. A
clergyman of my acquaintance, Mr. G. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t</span>, a keen sportsman
in his younger days, told me that when he was partridge-shooting
once in Essex, a favourite pointer of his, that was ranging at a
rapid pace alongside a thick hedge, coming suddenly upon an
opening where there should have been a gate, instantly wheeled
round and ran to heel, and then commenced carefully advancing
with a stiffened stern towards the gap; and so led his master up to
live birds which were lying close to it, but on the further side.
Evidently the <i>cautious</i> dog,&mdash;for he was no blinker,&mdash;on so unexpectedly
finding himself in such close vicinity to the covey, must
have fancied that his presence would alarm them, however motionless
he might remain.</span></p>

<p id="para_196">196. Though you cannot improve a dog&#8217;s nose, you
can do what is really tantamount to it&mdash;you can increase
his caution. By watching for the slightest token of his
feathering, and then calling out &#8220;Toho,&#8221; or making the
signal, you will gradually teach him to look out for the
faintest indication of a scent, and <i>point the instant he
winds it</i>, instead of heedlessly hunting on until he meets
a more exciting effluvia. &#40;See <a href="#para_259">259</a> to <a href="#para_261">261</a>, also <a href="#para_329">329</a>.&#41;
If from a want of animation in his manner you are not
able to judge of the moment when he first winds game,
and therefore are unable to call out &#8220;Toho&#8221; until he
gets close to birds, quietly pull him back from his point
&#8220;dead to leeward&#8221; for some paces, and there make him
resume his point. Perseverance in this plan will ultimately
effect your wishes, unless his nose be radically
wrong. A dog&#8217;s pointing too near his game more frequently
arises from want of caution,&mdash;in other words,
from want of good instruction,&mdash;than from a defective
nose.</p>

<div class="pageheader">CAUTION TAUGHT.</div>

<p id="para_197">197. Slow dogs readily acquire this caution; but fast
dogs cannot be taught it without great labour. You
have to show them the necessity of diminishing their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
pace, that their noses may have fair play. If you have
such a pupil to instruct, when you get near birds you
have marked down, signal to him to come to &#8220;heel.&#8221;
<i>Whisper</i> to him &#8220;Care,&#8221; and let him see by your light,
slow tread your anxiety not to alarm the game. If he
has never shown any symptoms of blinking, you may, a
few times, thus spring the birds yourself while you keep
him close to you. On the next occasion of marking
down birds, or coming to a very likely spot, bring him
into &#8220;heel,&#8221; and after an impressive injunction to take
&#8220;care,&#8221; give him two or three very limited casts to the
right or left, and let <i>him</i> find the game while you
instruct him as described in <a href="#para_329">329</a>. As there will be no
fear of such a dog making false points, take him often
to the fields where he has most frequently met birds.
The expectation of again coming on them, and the
recollection of the lectures he there received, will be
likely to make him cautious on entering it. I remember
a particular spot in a certain field that early in the
season constantly held birds. A young dog I then
possessed never approached it afterwards without drawing
upon it most carefully, though he had not found
there for months. At first I had some difficulty in
preventing the &#8220;draw&#8221; from becoming a &#8220;point.&#8221;</p>

<p id="para_198">198. I have elsewhere observed that fast dogs, which
give most trouble in breaking, usually turn out best.
Now if you think for a moment you will see the reason
plainly. A young dog does not ultimately become first-rate
because he is wild and headstrong, and regardless
of orders, but because his speed and disobedience arise
from his great energies,&mdash;from his fondness for the
sport; from his longing to inhale the exhilarating scent
and pursue the flying game. It is the possession of
these qualities that makes him, in his anxious state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
excitement, blind to your signals and deaf to your calls.
These obviously are qualities that, <i>under good management</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
lead to great excellence and superiority,&mdash;that
make one dog do the work of two. But they are not
qualities sought for by an idle or incompetent breaker.
He would prefer the kind of dog mentioned in <a href="#para_280">280</a>,
and boast much of the ability he had displayed in
training him. These valuable qualities in the fast dog,
must, however, be accompanied by a searching nose.
It is not enough that a dog be always apparently
hunting, that is to say, always on the gallop&mdash;his nose
should always be hunting. When this is the case &#40;and
you may be pretty certain it is if, as he crosses the
breeze, his nose has intuitively a bearing to windward&#41;,
you need not fear that he will travel too fast, or not
repay you ultimately for the great extra trouble caused
by his high spirits and ardour for the sport.</p>

<div class="pageheader">CAUTIOUS DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_199"><span class="small">199. The Rev. Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t</span> &#40;spoken of in <a href="#para_195">195</a>&#41; had one of these
valuable, fast, but cautious dogs. The dog, in leaping over a stile
that led from an orchard and crowned a steep bank, accidentally
tumbled head over heels. He rolled to the bottom of the bank,
and there remained motionless on his back. Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t</span> went up
in great distress, fancying his favourite must have been seriously
injured. However, on his approaching the dog, up sprung some
partridges, which, it appears, the <i>careful</i> animal must have winded,
and fearing to disturb, would not move a muscle of his body, for
happily he was in no way hurt by the fall.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">QUAILS TREEING.</div>

<p id="para_200"><span class="small">200. I was shooting in the upper provinces of Canada over a
young dog, who suddenly checked himself and came to a stiff &#8220;set&#8221;
on the top of a high zigzag log fence. I could not believe that he
was cunning enough to do this for the purpose of deceiving me,
because I was rating him for quitting the field before me; and yet
why should he be pointing in mid-air as rigidly as if carved in
stone? On my going up the enigma was solved, by a bevy of quail
flying out of a neighbouring tree.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It is said they often take to them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in America: but this was the only instance I ever saw. But we
will now hark back to your pup, which, for your sake, I wish may
turn out as cautious a dog.</span></p>

<p id="para_201">201. You have been recommended invariably to enter
every field by the leeward side. This you can generally
accomplish with ease, if you commence your day&#8217;s beat
to leeward. Should circumstances oblige you to enter
a field on the windward side, make it a rule, as long as
your dog continues a youngster, to call him to &#8220;heel,&#8221;
and walk down the field with him until you get to the
opposite side &#40;the leeward&#41;,&mdash;then hunt him regularly
up to windward.</p>

<p id="para_202">202. I have read wondrous accounts of dogs, who,
without giving themselves the trouble of quartering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
their ground, would walk straight up to the birds if
there were any in the field. It has never been my
luck, I do not say to have possessed such marvellous
animals, but even to have been favoured with a
sight of them. I therefore am inclined to think that,
let your means be what they may, you would find it
better not to advertise for creatures undoubtedly most
rare, but to act upon the common belief that, as the
scent of birds, more or less, impregnates the air, no dog,
let his nose be ever so fine, can, except accidentally,
wind game unless he seek for the taint in the air,&mdash;and
that the dog who regularly crosses the wind must have
a better chance of finding it, than he who only works
up wind,&mdash;and that down wind he can have little other
chance than by &#8220;roading.&#8221;</p>

<span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;y</span>, mentioned in <a href="#para_99">99</a>, having seen the preceding paragraph,

such a dog occasionally may be found, and gave good reasons for so

I felt it a kind of duty to give my readers the most accurate information

<p id="para_204"><span class="small">204. &#8220;I should like to show you the portrait of a favourite old
pointer of mine, who certainly had the gift of walking up straight

them, and about which I see you are naturally somewhat sceptical.
It was in this wise:&mdash;</span></p>

<p id="para_205"><span class="small">205. &#8220;I had gone down into Wales, with my Norfolk pointers, in
order to commit great slaughter upon some packs of grouse frequenting
the moors belonging to my brother-in-law; my dogs, I
think, were fair average ones, but the three did not find so many
birds, I was going to say, in a week as old &#8216;Grouse&#8217; &#40;the pointer
alluded to&#41; did in a day. She had been, previous to my arrival, a
sort of hanger-on about the stables,&mdash;gaining a scanty subsistence
by foraging near the house,&mdash;until she was four years old, without
ever having been taken to the adjoining moor, at least, in a regular
way.</span></p>

</div>

<p id="para_206"><span class="small">206. &#8220;One morning as I was riding up to the moor she followed
me; happening to cast my eyes to the right I saw her pointing
very steadily in a batch of heather not far from a young plantation.
I rode up, and a pack of grouse rose within twenty yards. This
induced me to pay more attention to my four-footed companion;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and the result was, that in a week&#8217;s time the Norfolk pointers were
shut up in the kennel, and the neglected &#8216;Grouse&#8217; became my
constant associate. A more eccentric animal, however, cannot well
be conceived. She hunted just what ground she liked&mdash;paid no
attention whatever to call or whistle&mdash;would have broken the hearts
of a dozen Norfolk keepers, by the desperate manner in which she
set all rules for quartering at defiance,&mdash;but she found game with
wonderful quickness, and in an extraordinary manner. She seemed,
in fact, to have the power of going direct to where birds lay, without
taking the preliminary trouble of searching for them; and, when
the packs of grouse were wild, I have seen her constantly leave her
point, make a wide circuit, and come up in such direction as to get
them between herself and me.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;She was, in every way, a most singular creature. No one did
she regard as her master:&mdash;no one would she obey. She showed as
little pleasure when birds fell, as disappointment when they flew
away; but continued her odd, eccentric movements until she became
tired or birds scarce, and then quietly trotted home, totally
regardless of my softest blandishments or my fiercest execrations.</span></p>

<p id="para_208"><span class="small">208. &#8220;She was beautifully-shaped, with round well-formed feet,
her forehead prominent, and her nostrils expanded more, I think,
than I ever saw in any dog.</span></p>

and pay my own pikes,&#8221; to see such an animal; but, &#8220;Grouse,&#8221;
being, unhappily, no longer in the land of the living, I was forced
to content myself with merely looking at her portrait. This, however,
afforded me much pleasure; I therefore obtained the owner&#8217;s
permission to have it engraved. He says that she always much
arched her loins when at a point close to game, and that the artist
has most happily hit off her attitude. She is the darker dog of the
two, and stands, as soldiers say, on the &#8220;<i>proper</i> left.&#8221; Her companion,
&#8220;Juno,&#8221; was far from a bad bitch.</span></p>

<p id="para_212"><span class="small">212. The longer the time that has elapsed since the emission
of particles of scent, the more feeble is that scent, on account of
the greater dispersion of the said particles; but, from the greater
space<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> they then occupy, a dog would necessarily have a greater
chance of meeting some of them, though, possibly, his nose might
not be fine enough to detect them.</span></p>

<p id="para_213"><span class="small">213. Now, my idea is, that &#8220;Grouse&#8217;s&#8221; exquisite sense of smell
made her often imagine the possible vicinity of game from the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
faintest indications,&mdash;that her sagacity led her not to abandon
hastily such tokens, however feeble, but rather to seek patiently for
a confirmation or disproval of her surmises,&mdash;that these fancies of
hers often ending in disappointment, her manner did not exhibit
any excitement that could have induced a spectator to guess what
was passing in her mind,&mdash;that he, therefore, noticed nothing unusual
until after the removal of her hesitation and doubts, when he
observed her walking calmly direct up to her birds,&mdash;and that he
thus was led to regard as an unexplained faculty what really ought
to have been considered as simply an evidence of extreme sensitiveness
of nose combined with marvellous caution,&mdash;a caution it is
the great aim of good breaking to inculcate. If I am right in my
theory, extraordinary &#8220;finder&#8221; as &#8220;Grouse&#8221; was, she would have
been yet more successful had she been taught to range properly.</span></p>

more inclined to commit this error from the rivalry of

their own time, quietly and methodically, to work out

<div class="pageheader">HON. F. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;H&#8217;S</span> RETRIEVER.</div>

<p id="para_216"><span class="small">216. An old brother officer of mine, the Hon. F. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;h</span>, has a
very handsome black retriever that possesses the extraordinary gift
of being able to run direct to any game, or even glove, you may
leave behind you, however tortuous may be your subsequent path.
<span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;h</span> told me that he has, in the presence of keepers, frequently
dropped a rabbit within sight of the dog, and then walked in a
circle, or rather semicircle, to the other side of a low hill&mdash;a distance,
possibly, of nearly a mile&mdash;before he desired the dog to fetch it;
yet, on receiving the order, the animal invariably set off in an undeviating
line straight to the rabbit, unless his attention had been
drawn away by playing with other dogs&mdash;a license <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;h</span> sometimes
designedly allowed. The retriever would then shuffle about a
little before he went off, but when he started it would be in as direct
a line to the object as usual.</span></p>

<p id="para_217"><span class="small">217. No one could explain by what sense or faculty he performed
this feat. It appears not to have been by the aid of his olfactory
powers, for <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;h</span> &#40;who is a keen sportsman, and capital shot,
by-the-bye&#41; would often purposely manage that the dog, when he was
desired to &#8220;fetch&#8221; the object, should be immediately to windward
of it; and in the most unfavourable position, therefore, for deriving
any advantage from the exercise of his nasal organs.</span></p>

<p id="para_218"><span class="small">218. Capt. <span class="glue">G&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, R.N. mentioned to me, that a ship, in which
he had served many years ago in the Mediterranean, seldom entered
a port that the large Newfoundland belonging to her did not jump
overboard the instant the anchor was dropped, swim ashore, and
return, after an hour or two&#8217;s lark, direct to his own ship, though
she might be riding in a crowd of vessels. He would then bark,
anxiously, until the bight of a rope was hove to him. Into this he
would contrive to get his fore-legs, and, on his seizing it firmly with
his teeth, the sailors, who were much attached to him, would hoist
him on board.</span></p>

<p id="para_219"><span class="small">219. Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;b</span>, of <span class="glue">S&mdash;&mdash;a</span>, had a young Newfoundland that
from very puppyhood took fearlessly to water, but acquired as he

to part with him, and accordingly made him a present to his

&#8220;Cameleon.&#8221; &#8220;Triton,&#8221; however, was so attached to his old roving
habits, that whenever the cutter went into port he would invariably
swim ashore of his own accord, and remain away for several days,
always managing, however, to return on board before the anchor
was weighed. Such, too, was his intelligence that he never seemed
puzzled how to pick out his own vessel from amidst forty or fifty
others. Indeed, Lieut. <span class="glue">P&mdash;&mdash;d</span>, &#40;he lately commanded the &#8220;Vulcan,&#8221;&#41;
to whom the question, at my request, was expressly put,
believes, &#40;and he has courteously permitted me to quote his name
and words,&#41; that, on one occasion, &#8220;Triton&#8221; contrived to find his
own vessel from among nearly a hundred that were riding at anchor
in Poole harbour. The dog&#8217;s being ever so well acquainted with the
interior of the craft does not explain why he should be familiar
with her external appearance. Did he judge most by the hull or
the rigging?</span></p>

<p id="para_220"><span class="small">220. The Duke of <span class="glue">N&mdash;&mdash;k</span> so much admired the magnificent
style in which &#8220;Triton&#8221; would spring into the strongest sea, that

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;BREAKING FENCE.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_222">222. Of course, you will not let your pupil &#8220;break
fence,&#8221; or get out of your sight. If he be a small, active
pointer or setter he may be out of sight before you are
aware of it. Be on the watch to whistle or call out
&#8220;Fence,&#8221; the instant you perceive that he is thinking of
quitting the field. Do not wait until he is over; check
him by anticipating his intentions. Should he, unperceived,
or in defiance of your orders, get into a field
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
before you, call him back &#40;by the same opening, if
practicable, through which he passed, the more clearly
to show him his folly&#41;; and do not proceed further
until he has obeyed you. A steady adherence to this
rule will soon convince him of the inutility of not
exercising more patience, or at least forbearance; then
signal to him &#8220;away&#8221; in the direction <i>you</i> choose, not
in the direction <i>he</i> chooses. It is essential that you
should be the first over every fence. In the scramble,
birds, at which you ought to have a shot, are frequently
sprung. If he is not obedient to your orders make him
&#8220;drop,&#8221; and rate him as described in <a href="#para_188">188</a>.</p>

<p id="para_223">223. A dog from his own observation so much feels,&mdash;and
in a greater or less degree, according to his education,&mdash;the
necessity of watching in what direction you
are walking, that if he is habituated to work under your
eye,&mdash;I mean, is never allowed to hunt behind you,&mdash;by
turning your back upon him when he is paying no
attention to your signals, you will often be able to
bring him away from a spot where he is ranging &#40;perhaps
down wind&#41; against your wishes, at a time when you
are afraid to whistle, lest you should alarm the birds.
Waving your hand backwards and forwards near the
ground, and stooping low while walking slowly about,
as if in search of something, will often attract the
attention of an ill-taught self-willed dog; and his
anxiety to participate in the find, and share the sport
which he imagines you expect, will frequently induce
him to run up, and hunt alongside of you for any close
lying bird.</p>

<div class="pageheader">TIRED DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_224">224. Never be induced to hunt your young dog, &#40;nor
indeed, any dog&#41;, when he is tired. If you do, you will
give him a slovenly carriage and habits, and lessen his
zeal for the sport. In order to come in for a sniff, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a time when he is too fatigued to search for it himself,
he will crawl after his companion, watching for any
indication of his finding. As they become wearied you
will have a difficulty in keeping your old well broken
dogs separate&mdash;much more young ones, however independently
they may have ranged when fresh. You
may also, to a certainty, expect false points; but what
is of far more consequence, by frequently overtasking
your young dog, you will as effectually waste his constitution
as you would your horse&#8217;s by premature work.</p>

<p id="para_225">225. If he is very young when first entered, two or
three hours&#8217; work at a time will be sufficient. When he
is tired, or rather before he is tired, send him home with
the man who brings you a relief. Do not fancy your
dog will be getting a rest if he be allowed to follow at
your heels for the remainder of the day, coupled to a
companion. His fretting at not being allowed to share
in the sport he sees, will take nearly as much out of
him as if you permitted him to hunt. If you can persuade
John always to rub him down, and brush and dry
him&mdash;nay even to let him enjoy an hour&#8217;s basking in
front of the fire&mdash;before he shuts him up in the kennel,
you will add years to his existence; and remember that
one old experienced dog, whose constitution is uninjured,
is worth two young ones.</p>

<div class="pageheader">VIGOUR IN OLD AGE.</div>

<p id="para_226"><span class="small">226. A gentleman in Eyrecourt, County Galway, gave me, as a
valuable present, a black setter thirteen years of age. And most
valuable was the setter to my friend, who had carefully reared him
from a puppy, and had him well under command; but with me
he was so <i>wild</i>,&mdash;I make use of the term most advisedly,&mdash;that
he did me more harm than good the only season I shot over him.
He was stolen from me, and his teeth were so sound, and he bore
so little the appearance of age, that I have no doubt he was sold as
a tolerably young dog. He was the best specimen I ever saw of
the vigour that may be retained for old age by judicious treatment
in youth. The excellence of his constitution was the more remarkable,
from the fact of his having always been extremely fond of the
water. Few dogs could equal him for flapper shooting, that vilest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of sports, if followed before the unfortunate birds get strong on the
wing&mdash;as unprofitable, too, for the table, as unsatisfactory to the
real sportsman. Sir <span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, of Perthshire, told me that he
had shot grouse over an Oxfordshire pointer bitch &#40;the best he ever
possessed and the founder of his kennel-stock&#41; until she was eighteen
years of age, when she could do no more than crawl up the side of
a hill, occasionally, to gain time, making false points. Once, however,
on the top, she would work merrily downwards,&mdash;no false
points then.</span></p>

<p id="para_227"><span class="small">227. But canine veterans, of however invalided a constitution, if
they have been really first-rate in their youth, are not always to be
despised. Occasionally you may come across one who will, from his
past experience and superior nose, prove a more valuable auxiliary
in the field, than many a campaigner of greater activity and vigour.</span></p>

<p id="para_228"><span class="small">228. Many years ago I went from the south of England for some
grouse-shooting in Scotland. When arranging with my companion
&#40;Captain <span class="glue">S&mdash;&mdash;s</span>, a connexion of the kind-hearted old warrior, whose
crowning victory was Goojerat,&#41; what dogs should accompany us, he
remarked, that it would be useless to take his old Dropper &#40;one far
more resembling a pointer than a setter&#41;, as he was too aged to
undergo any work. I observed, that he could do us no harm if he
did us no good; and, as he had been an admirable animal, I advised
his being taken. Off he went to the North; and frequently did we
afterwards congratulate ourselves upon this decision, for the old
fellow, apparently grateful for the compliment seemed to feel that
he ought to make us some return, and that the less ground he could
traverse with his legs the more he was bound to traverse with his
nose. The result was, that while he was slowly pottering about,
&#40;the season being unusually hot and dry, there was but little scent&#41;
he was constantly finding us birds which his more flashy companions
had passed over; and before we left Scotland we agreed that none
of our dogs had procured us so many shots as the slow, careful old
gentleman.</span></p>

<p id="para_229"><span class="small">229. Old birds become very cunning; they are quite sensible of
the danger they incur by rising, and to escape from the dog, and
puzzle him, have as many wiles and twists as a hunted hare. It
may be that as old age advances, their decreasing bodily powers
warn them to add to their security by the exercise of their wits.
It is often remarked, that if ever we kill any of their natural
enemies, whether winged or four-footed, we are sure to find them
in fair condition. This condition makes it obvious, that they must
have gained with years the experience which enables them to obtain
a good livelihood by craft, at a time of life when their failing strength
would prevent their procuring a single meal by a direct pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
If then we argue from analogy, we shall think it almost impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for any unpractised dog, however highly-bred, to procure us so many
shots as one who has been hunted for several seasons. And such is
really the case. A young dog will not keep to the trail of an old
bird for more than about forty yards; after that he will give it up
altogether, or rush in. It is when he is &#8220;roading&#8221; one of these
knowing aged patriarchs, that you become aware of the great value
of experience in a dog. You may have seen a young one bewildered
in the devious intricacies of the broken hags, sought as a refuge by an
old cock-grouse, and have probably imagined that the youngster had
only been following a recent haunt, and that the game was gone.
Not so, the dog was right at first. He &#8220;footed&#8221; it out admirably
until he came to the dark bush, which you must have wondered to
see growing in such a situation; there the sly bird doubled, then
turned short to the right for nearly a hundred yards before it resumed
its course down wind. A dog more up to his work would
have again hit off the scent, and an old stager, probably, never have
lost it.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;FALLS&#8221; OF UNDERWOOD.</div>

<p id="para_230"><span class="small">230. In order to be generally understood, I will preface the following
anecdote by mentioning that in the large Kentish woods,
where the annual falls of underwood take place to the extent of
forty or fifty acres, it is usual to drain the land by digging water-courses,
or as they are commonly called, Grips. The first year&#8217;s
growth of the underwood is called yearling Fall &#40;or Spring&#41;; the
second, two-year old Fall &#40;or Spring&#41;; and so on.</span></p>

<p id="para_231"><span class="small">231. Mr. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, a good sportsman, and so successful an angler,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
that he is familiarly called by his friends &#8220;the King-fisher,&#8221; to distinguish
him from others who bear his name, was pheasant shooting
in the winter of 1848&ndash;9, in two-year old springs, where, with all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
acknowledged partiality for Kent, it must be admitted that birds
are not so plentiful as in certain preserves in Norfolk, though probably
foxes are fully as numerous. It has been remarked, by-the-bye,
that where foxes abound, old pheasants are very cunning;
doubtless from having been often put to their shifts to escape from
their wily adversaries.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">EXTRAORDINARY CHASE.</div>

<p id="para_232"><span class="small">232. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> sprung a splendid cock-pheasant, which, although
a long way off, he shot at and dropped. Judging from the manner
in which it fell that it was a runner, and well knowing the racing
propensities of the old cocks, he hastened to the spot where it
tumbled, and, giving his gun to the marker, prepared for a sharp
burst, though he little expected the extraordinary chase that was to
follow. He found, as he had anticipated, some breast feathers, but
no bird. After fruitlessly trying in every direction, for nearly a
quarter of an hour, to put &#8220;Dash&#8221; on the scent, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g&#8217;s</span> eyes
rested on one of the grips just spoken of: it ran close to where the
bird had fallen, and the thought struck him that possibly the cunning
creature might have taken refuge in it, and thus have thrown
out the spaniel. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> got into it, and though finding fully six
inches of water, he persevered in following it. It brought him to
a high wood about one hundred yards off, and towards which the
pheasant had been flying when shot at, but &#8220;Dash&#8221; could not obtain
the least scent of the bird. As a last resource, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> then returned
to the spot where he had left the marker with his gun, being determined
to try the grip in the opposite direction, notwithstanding its
leading exactly contrary to the point for which the bird had been
making. He did so, and by calling energetically to &#8220;Dash,&#8221; he
endeavoured to make the dog believe that at length the bird was in
view. The plan succeeded. &#8220;Dash,&#8221; who had become slack from
disappointment, hunted with renewed animation, and, after pursuing
the grip for some time, took the scent full cry across the
springs until he came to an old waggon-road, along which he went
at speed. Feeling assured that all was now right, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> gladly
moderated his pace, for he was much out of breath. When at
length he overtook &#8220;Dash,&#8221; instead of seeing him in possession of
the bird, he only found him completely at fault, trying up and
down the well-indented wheel-ruts. On the other side of the road
there was another grip. Into it <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> jumped, followed the plan
he had before adopted, and with like success; for on running up the
grip for about sixty yards, the spaniel again hit off the scent, and
after taking it away at a right angle &#40;so far that <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> could only
now and then catch a faint tingle of the bell&#41;, brought it back to
the same grip, but some 200 yards higher, where he suddenly
&#8220;threw up.&#8221; For the fourth time in went <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>. &#8220;Dash&#8221; now
seemed thoroughly to understand matters, and kept trying both
sides of the grip for the scent. At length he found it, and went
full cry across a yearling fall, which was everywhere very bare,
except here and there an occasional patch of high strong grass. At
one of these <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> found him again at fault. The dog seemed
quite done; but still it was evident, from his excited manner, that

he thought the pheasant was not far distant. After a time he began
scratching at the long grass. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> went up, and, on putting the
stalks aside, fancied he perceived the end of some tail feathers.
He thrust in his arm, and ultimately succeeded in dragging forth
the well-hunted bird, quite alive, out of the deep wheel-track in
which it had buried itself. The coarse grass had grown so closely
over the rut, that the bird had been able to creep in for three or four
yards.</span></p>

<p id="para_233"><span class="small">233. A more miserable appearance than the poor creature presented,
cannot easily be conceived. Its feathers were so completely
sopped, and stuck so close to its body, that it looked a mere
skeleton; and yet it was a noble bird, measuring three feet and an
inch from the tip of its bill to the extremity of its tail, and weighed
3 lbs. 6 oz.</span></p>

<p id="para_234"><span class="small">234. As &#8220;Dash&#8221; plays so conspicuous a part in the foregoing
history, it appears right that a few words should be given to describe
him. He is a low, strong-limbed, broad-backed nearly thorough-bred
Sussex spaniel, with an extremely intelligent-looking head, but
a sadly mean stern. His colour is black. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> generally hunts
him with a bell, especially where the underwood is thick. If he is
sharply called to when he is on game he will slacken his pace, look
round for his master, and not &#8220;road&#8221; keenly until the gun approaches
him; he will then rush in with a bark to flush, though at
other times hunting mute. The intelligent animal seems, however,
perfectly to know when the cover is too high or strong for <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>
to follow, for he then invariably runs full cry from first touching on
a scent. He never deceives the sportsman, for he never gives one
of his eloquent looks unless he is certain of being on game; and
his nose is so good, and he hunts so true, that he invariably
&#8220;pushes&#8221; his pheasant, however much it may turn or double.</span></p>

<p id="para_235"><span class="small">235. He is also undeniable at &#8220;seeking dead,&#8221; but unluckily
was not taught as a youngster to fetch. Much time is, therefore,
often lost in finding him after he has been sent for a winged bird;
but when he is at length discovered it is sure to be with him.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SAGACITY OF A PHEASANT.</div>

<p id="para_236"><span class="small">236. I was told of a farmer in Kent&mdash;one of her fine yeomen, of
whom England has such cause to feel proud, &#40;pity that in some other
counties the class is not as distinctly preserved!&#41;&mdash;who was shooting
with an old short-legged, strong-loined, Sussex spaniel. The dog,
after &#8220;roading&#8221; a pheasant along many a tortuous path, led the
farmer to the edge of a shallow brook, up the middle of which, far
away to his right, he was lucky enough to see the animal running,
obviously with the design of throwing out the dog. A light pair of
heels soon brought the sportsman within shot, and enabled him to
bag the heaviest and richest feathered bird he had ever seen. The
sharp long spurs<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
showed it to be at least five years of age, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sagacity would probably have borne it triumphantly through another
campaign or two, had not the farmer&#8217;s quick eye detected its adroit
man&oelig;uvre,&mdash;one that forcibly calls to mind Cooper&#8217;s descriptions of
the stratagems employed by the North American Indians to baffle
pursuit by leaving no indication of their trail.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">AGE IN DOGS ADVANTAGEOUS.</div>

<p id="para_237"><span class="small">237. Must there not be experience on the part of dogs to contend
successfully with such wiliness as this? So much was the last Duke
of Gordon convinced of its necessity,&mdash;and he is well known to
have been a capital sportsman, and to have paid great attention to
his fine breed of black setters,&mdash;that he would never allow one of
them to accompany him to the moors that had not been shot over
five or six seasons&mdash;and &#8220;small blame&#8221; to his Grace &#8220;for that
same,&#8221; as he had a choice from all ages. But it must be acknowledged,
that however excellent<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
in many respects,&mdash;and when in the
hands of the breaker their indomitable energies would cause the
bunch of heather, fastened to the end of their checkcords, to dance
merrily over the mountains from morning until night-fall,&mdash;most of
them were a wild set in their youth, and required constant work to
keep them in order. Every experienced sportsman in the Highlands
is aware that young dogs will romp &#40;for it cannot be termed
hunting&#41;, with their noses here, there, and everywhere, obtaining but
few points over ground on which knowing old dogs will immediately
afterwards keep the gun-barrels at an exhilarating temperature.</span></p>

<p id="para_238">238. When you hunt a brace of dogs, to speak theoretically,
they should traverse a field in opposite directions,
but along parallel lines, and the distance between the lines
should be regulated by you according as it is a good or
a bad scenting day, and according to the excellence of
the dogs&#8217; noses. Mathematical accuracy is, of course,
never to be attained, but the closer you approach to it
the better.</p>

<p id="para_239">239. You should attempt it &#40;on entering the field to
<i>leeward</i>, as before directed&#41; by making one dog go straight
ahead of you to the distance which you wish the parallel
lines to be apart from each other, before you cast him
off &#40;say&#41; to the right; then cast off his companion to
the left. If the dogs are nearly equal in pace, the one
ahead, so long as he does not fancy he winds game,
should continue to work on a parallel more advanced
than the other.</p>

<p id="para_240">240. Should you not like to relinquish, for the sake
of this formal precision, the chance of a find in the
neglected right-hand corner of the field, cast off one
dog to the right, the other to the left on entering it,
and make the one that soonest approaches his hedge
take the widest sweep &#40;turn&#41;, and so be placed in the
<i>advanced</i> parallel.</p>

<p id="para_241">241. With regard to hunting more than a brace&mdash;when
your difficulties wonderfully multiply&mdash;your own
judgment must determine in what manner to direct
their travelling powers to the greatest advantage. Much
will depend upon the different speed of the dogs; the
number you choose, from whim or otherwise, to hunt;
the kind of country you beat; and the quantity and
sort of game you expect to find. It is, however, certain
you must wish that each dog be observant of the direction
in which your face is turned, in order that he may
guide his own movements by yours;&mdash;that he from time
to time look towards you to see if you have any commands;&mdash;and
that he be ever anxious to obey them.</p>

<p><span class="small">Herbert writes as follows, in his work on shooting in the United States:<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
his words ought to have influence, for manifestly he is
a good sportsman; but I own I cannot quite agree with him as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the <i>facility</i> with which a range can be taught: &#8220;It is wonderful
how easily dogs which are always shot over by the same man&mdash;he
being one who knows his business&mdash;will learn to cross and re-quarter
their ground, turning to the slightest whistle, and following the least
gesture of the hand. I have seen old dogs turn their heads to catch
their master&#8217;s eye, if they thought the whistle too long deferred;
and I lately lost an old Irish setter, which had been stone deaf for
his last two seasons, but which I found no more difficulty in turning
than any other dog, so accurately did he know when to look for the
signal.&#8221;</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BEAT OF THREE DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_242">242. To beat your ground <i>systematically</i> with three
dogs you should strive to make them cross and re-cross
you, each on a different parallel, as just described for
two dogs; but each dog must make a proportionately
bolder sweep &#40;turn&#41;; or,</p>

<p id="para_243">243. If you have plenty of space, you can make one
dog take a distinct beat to the right, another a separate
beat to the left, and direct the third &#40;which ought to be
the dog least confirmed in his range&#41; to traverse the
central part,&mdash;and so be the only one that shall cross
and re-cross you. If one of your dogs is a slow potterer,
and you prefer this method to the one named in
<a href="#para_242">242</a>, give him the middle beat, and let his faster companions
take the flanks. In our small English fields
you have not space enough, but on our moors, and in
many parts of the Continent, it cannot be want of room
that will prevent your accomplishing it. To do this
well, however, and not interfere with each other&#8217;s
ground, how magnificently must your dogs be broken!
In directing their movements, the assistance that would
be given you by each dog&#8217;s acknowledging his own
particular whistle, and no other &#40;<a href="#para_505">505</a>&#41;, is very apparent.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BEAT OF FOUR OR FIVE DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_244">244. It is difficult enough to make three dogs traverse
across you on tolerably distinct parallels, and at a judicious
distance between the parallels; you will find it
hopeless to attempt it with more than three; and one
can hardly imagine a case in which it would be advantageous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to uncouple a greater number of good rangers.
If, however, the scarcity of game, and the extensiveness
of your beat, or any peculiar fancy, induce you habitually
to use four dogs, hunt one brace to the right, the other
to the left; and, so far as you can, let those which <i>form
a brace be of equal speed</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Your task will be facilitated
by your always keeping the same brace to one
flank,&mdash;I mean, by making one brace constantly hunt
to your right hand; the other brace to your left. The
same reasoning holds with regard to assigning to each
dog a particular side when hunting three, according to
the mode described in last paragraph. It should, however,
be borne in mind, that constantly hunting a dog
in this manner on one and the same flank, tends to
make him range very disagreeably whenever employed
single-handed.</p>

<p id="para_245">245. If you hunt five dogs, four of them ought to
work by braces to the right and left, and the fifth &#40;the
dog whose rate of speed most varies from the others&#41;
should have a narrow beat assigned him directly in
advance of you.</p>

<p id="para_246">246. If three brace are to be used, let the third brace
hunt the central ground, as recommended for the fifth
dog,&mdash;or they could be worked in leashes, one on the
right of the gun, the other on the left.</p>

<p id="para_247">247. These are the correct <i>theoretical</i> rules, and the
more closely you observe them, the more truly and
killingly will your ground be hunted.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BRIGADES,&mdash;NOT PACKS.</div>

<p id="para_248">248. Probably you will think that such niceties are
utterly impracticable. They must be impracticable, if
you look for mathematical precision; but if you are determined
to hunt many dogs and hope to shoot over more
than a mere rabble, you should work upon <i>system</i>. If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
do not, what can you expect but an unorganized mob?&mdash;an
undrilled set, perpetually running over each other&#8217;s
ground,&mdash;now scampering in this part, now crowded
in that,&mdash;a few likely spots being hunted by all &#40;especially
if they are old dogs&#41;, the rest of the field by none
of them; and to control whose unprofitable wanderings,
why not employ a regular huntsman and a well-mounted
whip? Doubtless it would be absurd to hope for perfect
accuracy in so difficult a matter as a systematic range
in a brigade of dogs; but that you may approach correctness,
take a true standard of excellence. If you do
not keep perfection in view, you will never attain to
more than mediocrity. I earnestly hope, however, that
it cannot be your wish to take out a host of dogs,&mdash;but
should you have such a singular hobby, pray let them
be regularly brigaded, and not employed as a pack. In
my opinion, under no circumstances can more than
relays of leashes be desirable; but I should be sorry in
such matters to dispute any man&#8217;s right to please himself;
I only wish him, whatever he does, to strive to do
it correctly.</p>

<p id="para_249">249. Some men who shoot on a grand scale make
their keepers hunt each a distinct brace of dogs,&mdash;the
gun going up to whatever dog points. It is the most
killing plan to adopt; but that is not the matter we
were considering. The question was, what method a
man ought to pursue who had a fancy to himself hunt
many dogs at a time.</p>

<div class="pageheader">MAJOR <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;D&#8217;S</span> BRIGADE.</div>

<p id="para_250"><span class="small">250. The late Major <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;d</span>, of <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;d</span>, in Lancashire, had this
fancy. The moors over which he shot were by no means well-stocked
with game; but the wonderful control he obtained over
his pointers showed, in the strongest manner, the high grade of
education that can be imparted to dogs by gentle and judicious
treatment.</span></p>

<p id="para_251"><span class="small">251. He was accustomed to hunt three brace at a time. Each
dog when he was ranging would take up his separate ground, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
interfering with that of his companions. The Major&#8217;s raising
his arm was the signal for all to drop.</span></p>

<p id="para_252"><span class="small">252. If one of the dogs was pointing, the Major would go up
perhaps to the dog furthest off, and make him approach the dog
that was standing; and in October &#40;when grouse run much&#41; he
has thus brought all six dogs in a line, one following the other,
and made each in succession take the lead, and &#8220;foot&#8221; the birds for
a short distance. The same dogs, on the same day, at a given
signal, would run riot; scamper over the moor; chase hares, sheep,
or anything they came across; and at the well-known signal again
would drop, and, as if by magic, resume their perfect obedience.</span></p>

<p id="para_253"><span class="small">253. Major <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;d</span> was quite one of the old school; used flint
and steel; and looked with ineffable contempt at the detonators of
the youngsters. He was not remarkable for being a good shot,
capital sportsman as he undoubtedly was in the highest sense of the
word, showing the truth of what was said in the <a href="#para_5">fifth</a> paragraph,
that excellence in shooting, though of course advantageous, is not a
necessary qualification in a breaker.</span></p>

<p id="para_254">254. If a professional breaker could show you a
brigade of dogs well trained to quarter their ground
systematically, and should ask from fifty to sixty guineas<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
a brace for them, you ought not to be surprised.
What an extent of country they could sweep
over in an hour and not leave a bird behind! And
consider what time and labour must have been spent
in inculcating so noble a range. He would have been
far better paid, if he had received less than half the
money as soon as they &#8220;pointed steadily,&#8221; both at the
living and the dead; &#8220;down charged;&#8221; &#8220;backed;&#8221; and
were broken from &#8220;chasing hare,&#8221; or noticing rabbits.</p>

<p id="para_255"><span class="small">255. The great advantage of fine rangers is not much considered
where game is abundant. A friend of mine, a capital shot &#40;though
far inferior to his namesake, Captain <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;s</span> of sporting celebrity&#41;,
with whom I have enjoyed some pleasant quail shooting in America,
used constantly to hunt a leash of pointers, &#8220;Jem,&#8221; &#8220;Beau,&#8221; and
&#8220;Fag,&#8221;&mdash;the last a regular misnomer, for the dog was incorrigibly
idle. It was curious to watch how pertinaciously, like sheep, they
herded together,&mdash;seldom did one wind a bird that would not have
been found a few seconds afterwards by the others. <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;</span>s, long
before I knew him, had relinquished all attempts at making them
beat separately&mdash;indeed, I am not positive that he was fully sensible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of its utility. As they all &#8220;backed&#8221; promptly&mdash;instantly &#8220;down charged,&#8221;
and had not a shade of jealousy, they did little harm;
and sometimes on a broiling day &#8220;Beau,&#8221; who generally took the
lead, was not the first to come on a dead bird. Where game is
plentiful, as bad rangers as the trio belonging to my old friend, will
afford you sport; but it is certain that they will pass by many birds,
unless you undergo the fatigue of walking over most of the ground
yourself, and it is clear if you do, that you will not be able to hunt
half as many acres in a day, as you could if you kept to your general
central direction while the dogs hunted according to rule. Few
Frenchmen agree with us respecting a fine range. They make their
pointers and setters hunt almost as close as spaniels. They prefer
bitches to dogs, saying that they are more affectionate &#40;&#8220;plus
fid&egrave;les&#8221;&#41;, and therefore range nearer. In England, in old days,
when our dogs were far heavier and slower than they are now, and,
in consequence, could not run over so much ground, they were
taught to traverse little more than from thirty to sixty yards on
each side of the gun.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">FAST WALKING NOT MOST HUNTING.</div>

<p id="para_256">256. Some men fancy that the faster they walk, the
more country they hunt. This is far from being always
the case. Dogs travel at one rate, whether you walk
fast or slow, and the distance between the parallels on
which they work, &#40;being determined by the fineness of
their noses, and the goodness of the scent,&#41; ought not to
be affected by your pace. Suppose, therefore, that you
shoot in an unenclosed country, whether you walk
quickly, or merely crawl along, the only difference in
the beat of your dogs <i>ought</i> to be that, in the latter
case, they range further to the right and left. You thus
make up in your <i>breadth</i> what you lose in your <i>length</i>
of beat.</p>

<div class="pageheader">FINER NOSE BEATS QUICKER HEELS.</div>

<p id="para_257">257. Nor do the fastest dogs, however well they may
be broken, always truly hunt the most ground. The
slower dogs have frequently finer olfactory nerves than
their fleeter rivals,&mdash;therefore the parallels on which the
former work, may correctly be much wider apart than
the parallels of the latter. The finer nose in this
manner commands so much more ground, that it beats
the quicker heels out and out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p id="para_258">258. You will see, then, how judicious it is to show
forbearance and give encouragement to the timid, but high-bred class<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
of dogs described in <a href="#para_116">116</a>; for it is obvious that, though they may
travel slower, yet they may really hunt <i>properly</i>, within a specified
time, many more acres of ground than their hardier and faster
competitors: and it is certain that they will not so much alarm the
birds. Dogs that are most active with their heels are generally least
busy with their noses.</p>

<p id="para_259">259. To proceed, however, with our imaginary September
day&#8217;s work. I will suppose that your young
dog has got upon birds, and that from his boldness and
keenness in hunting you need not let him run riot on a
haunt, as you were recommended &#40;in <a href="#para_132">132</a>&#41;, when you
wished to give courage and animation to a timid dog.
You must expect that his eagerness and delight will
make him run in and flush them, even though you
should have called out &#8220;Toho&#8221; when first you perceived
his stern begin feathering, and thence judged that his
olfactory nerves were rejoicing in the luxurious taint of
game. Hollo out &#8220;Drop&#8221; most energetically. If he
does not immediately lie down, crack your whip loudly
to command greater attention. When you have succeeded
in making him lie down, approach him quietly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
be not angry with him, but yet be stern in manner.
Grasping the skin of his neck, or what is better, putting
your hand within his collar &#40;for he ought to wear a
light one&#41;, quietly drag him to the precise spot where
you think he was <i>first</i> aware of the scent of the birds.
There make him stand, &#40;if stand he will, instead of
timidly crouching&#41;, with his head directed towards the
place from which the birds took wing, and by frequently
repeating the word &#8220;Toho,&#8221; endeavour to make him
understand that he ought to have pointed at that
identical spot. Do not confuse him by even threatening
to beat him. The chances are twenty to one that he
is anxious to please you, but does not yet know what
you wish. I assume also that he is attached to you,
and his affection, from constantly inducing him to exert
himself to give satisfaction, will greatly develop his
observation and intelligence.</p>

<div class="pageheader">FIRST FIND.</div>

<p id="para_260">260. Consider it a golden rule never to be departed
from &#40;for I must again impress upon you a matter of
such importance&#41;, invariably to drag a dog who has put
up birds incautiously, or wilfully drawn too near them,
and so sprung them &#40;or, what is quite as bad,&mdash;though
young sportsmen will not sufficiently think of it,&mdash;<i>endangered</i>
their rising out of shot&#41;, to the exact spot at
which you judge he ought to have pointed at first, and
awaited your instructions.</p>

<div class="pageheader">POINT TOO NEAR GAME.</div>

<p id="para_261">261. Think for one moment what could be the use of
chiding &#40;or beating, as I have seen some * * * * * do&#41;
the poor animal at the spot where he flushed the birds.
You are not displeased with him &#40;or ought not to be&#41;
because the birds took wing,&mdash;for if they had remained
stationary until he was within a yard of them, his fault
would have been the same: nor are you angry with him
because he did not catch them &#40;which interpretation he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
might, as naturally as any other, put upon your rating
him at the spot where he flushed them&#41;,&mdash;you are
displeased with him for <i>not having pointed</i> at them
steadily the moment he became sensible of their
presence. This is what you wish him to understand,
and this you can only teach him by dragging
him, as has been so often said, to the spot at which he
ought to have &#8220;toho-ed&#8221; them. Your object is to give
the young dog by instruction, the caution that most old
dogs have acquired by experience. Doubtless experience
would in time convince him of the necessity of
this caution; but you wish to <i>save</i> time,&mdash;to anticipate
that experience; and by a judicious education impart
to him knowledge which it would take him years to
acquire otherwise. What a dog gains by experience is
not what you teach him, but what he teaches himself.</p>

<p id="para_262">262. Many carelessly-taught dogs will on first recognising
a scent make a momentary point, and then slowly
crawl on until they get within a few yards of the game,&mdash;if
it be sufficiently complaisant to allow of such a
near approach,&mdash;and there &#8220;set&#8221; as steady as a rock by
the hour together. Supposing, however, that the birds
are in an unfriendly distant mood, and not willing to
remain on these neighbourly terms, &#8220;your game is up,&#8221;
both literally and metaphorically,&mdash;you have no chance
of getting a shot. This is a common fault among dogs
hastily broken in the spring.</p>

<p><span class="small">I speak feelingly on the subject from a still unpleasant recollection
of my extreme vexation on a certain 20th of August,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> when
shooting over a young pointer bitch of excellent natural capabilities,
but who had been injudiciously allowed, during her tuition in the
spring, to stand too close to her birds. She was a quick ranger,&mdash;carried
a high diligent nose,&mdash;had much endurance, and procured
me several shots at young black game, but not one, if I remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
right, at grouse. I was always aware when she first found, for her
attitudes were fine and marked, but, in defiance of all my signals,
and occasional calls, she would persist in creeping nearer, a proximity
the grouse would not endure. As a violent jerk would not
have been necessary, often did I wish that day, whenever she approached
a likely spot, that it was in my power to attach to her
collar a stiff thin checkcord about 100 yards long,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
&mdash;such a one as would have been handed to me at a fishing-tackle shop on my
asking for a strong hemp salmon line,&mdash;the kind used in former
days after being soaked for weeks in oil,&mdash;now, however, considered
heavy and unmanageable. A mild spiked collar applied as described
in <a href="#para_302">302</a> to <a href="#para_304">304</a>, would, I think, have noiselessly reclaimed her, without
injuring my shooting.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">MUST NOT BE IN A HURRY.</div>

<p id="para_263">263. But to resume our supposed lesson. You must
not be in a hurry&mdash;keep your dog for some time&mdash;for a
long time, where he should have pointed. You may
even sit down alongside him. Be patient; you have
not come out so much to shoot, as to break in your dog.
When at length you give him the wave of the hand to
hie him on to hunt, you must not part as enemies,
though I do not say he is to be caressed. He has committed
a fault, and he is to be made sensible of it by
your altered manner.</p>

<p id="para_264">264. Suppose that, after two or three such errors, all
treated in the way described, he makes a satisfactory
point. Hold up your right hand, and the moment you
catch his eye, remain quite stationary, still keeping your
arm up. Dogs, as has been already observed, are very
imitative; and your standing stock-still will, more than
anything else, induce him to be patient and immovable
at his point. After a time &#40;say five minutes if, from the
hour of the day and the dog&#8217;s manner, you are convinced
that the birds are not stirring&#41;, endeavour to get up to
him so quietly as not to excite him to move. Whenever
you observe him inclined to advance,&mdash;of which his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
lifting a foot or even raising a shoulder, or the agitation
of his stern will be an indication,&mdash;stop for some seconds,
and when by your raised hand you have awed him into
steadiness, again creep on. Make your approaches within
his sight, so that he may be intimidated by your eye
and hand. If you succeed in getting near him without
unsettling him, actually stay by him, as firm as a statue,
for a quarter of an hour by one of Barwise&#8217;s best chronometers.
Let your manner, which he will observe, show
great earnestness. Never mind the loss of time. You
are giving the dog a famous lesson, and the birds are
kindly aiding you by lying beautifully and not shifting
their ground.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="pageheader">THE FIRST BIRD KILLED.</div>

<p id="para_265">265. Now attempt a grand <i>coup</i>, in which if you are
successful, you may almost consider your dog made
staunch for ever. Keeping your eye on him, and your
hand up &#40;of course the right one&#41;, make a circuit, so
that the birds shall be between him and you. Be
certain that your circle is sufficiently wide,&mdash;if it is not,
the birds may get up behind you, and so perplex him,
that at his next find he will feel doubtful how to act.
Fire at no skirter, or chance shot. Reserve yourself for
the bird or birds at which he points; a caution more
necessary on the moors than on the stubbles, as grouse
spread while feeding. When you have well headed him,
walk towards him and spring the birds. Use straight
shooting-powder. Take a cool aim well forward, and
knock down one. Do not flurry the dog by firing more
than a single barrel, or confuse him by killing more
than <i>one</i> bird. If you have been able to accomplish all
this without his stirring &#40;though, to effect it, you may
have been obliged to use your voice&#41;, you have every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
right to hope, from his previous education, that he will
readily &#8220;down charge&#8221; on hearing the report of your
gun. Do not hurry your loading:&mdash;indeed, be unnecessarily
long, with the view of making him at all such
times patient and steady. If, in spite of all your calls
and signals, he gives chase to the sprung birds, make
him &#8220;drop,&#8221;&mdash;instantly if possible,&mdash;and proceed much
as described in <a href="#para_259">259</a>, dragging him back to the place
where he should have &#8220;down charged.&#8221;</p>

<div class="pageheader">POINTING DEAD.</div>

<p id="para_266">266. When you have loaded, say, &#8220;Dead,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
in a low voice, and signalling to &#8220;heel&#8221; make him come up to
you, yourself keeping still. By signs &#40;<span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_XI">xi</a>.</span> of 141&#41; place
him as near as you can, <i>but to leeward</i> of the dead bird.
Then, and not till then, say, &#8220;Find;&#8221; give him no other
assistance. Let him have plenty of time to make out
the bird. It is not to be find and <i>grip</i>, but find and <i>point</i>,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
therefore the moment you perceive he is aware that it is before him,
make him &#40;by word of command&#41; &#8220;toho:&#8221;&mdash;go up to him, stay for a
while alongside him, then make a small circuit to head him, and have
the bird between you and him; approach him. If he attempt to dash in,
thunder out &#8220;No,&#8221; and greet him with at least the sound of the whip:
slowly pick up the dead bird; call the dog to you; show him the bird;
but on no account throw it to him, lest he snatch at it; lay it on
the ground, encourage him to sniff it; let him &#40;for reason why see
<a href="#para_313">313</a>&#41; turn it over with his nose,&mdash;teeth closed,&mdash;say to him,
&#8220;Dead, dead;&#8221; caress him;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
sit down; smooth the feathers of the bird; let him
perceive that you attach much value to it; and after a
while loop it on the game-bag, allowing him all the
time to see what you are doing. After that, make much
of him for full five minutes: indeed with some dogs it
would be advisable to give a palatable reward, but be
not invariably very prodigal of these allurements; you
may have a pupil whose attention they might engross
more than they ought. Then walk about a little time
with him at your heels. All this delay and caressing
will serve to show him that the first tragedy is concluded,
and has been satisfactorily performed. You may
now hie him on to hunt for more birds.</p>

</div>

<div class="pageheader">BLINKING DEAD.</div>

<p id="para_267">267. Pray mind what is said about making your
youngster point the dead bird staunchly, the moment
you perceive that he first scents it. Should he be
allowed to approach so near as to be able to touch it
&#40;instead of being made to point the instant he finds&#41;,
the chances are, that, if hard-mouthed he will give it a
crunch, if tender-mouthed a fumbling of the feathers;
and either proceeding satisfying him, that he will quit
it, and not further aid you in a search. As &#8220;pointing&#8221;
is only a natural pause &#40;prolonged by art&#41; to determine
exactly where the game is lying, preparatory to rushing
forward to seize, it would be unreasonable to expect him
willingly to make a second point at game he has not
only found but mouthed:&mdash;the evil, however, does not
rest here. There is such a disagreeable thing as blinking
a dead bird, no less than blinking a sound one. For
mouthing the bird you may possibly beat the dog, or for
nosing it and not pointing you may rate him harshly,
either of which, if he be not of a bold disposition, may
lead, on the next occasion, to his slinking off after
merely obtaining a sniff. You ought, in fact, to watch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
as carefully for your pupil&#8217;s first &#8220;feathering&#8221; upon the
dead bird, as you did &#40;<a href="#para_259">259</a>&#41; upon his first coming upon
the covey. You see, then, that your teaching him to
&#8220;point dead&#8221; is absolutely indispensable; unless, indeed,
you constantly shoot with a retriever. Pointing at a
live bird or at a dead one, should only differ in this, that
in the latter case the dog makes a nearer point. <i>Begin</i>
correctly, and you will not have any difficulty; but you
may expect the greatest, if you let your dog go up to
one or two birds and mouth them, before you commence
making him point them. The following season, should
you then permit him to lift his game &#40;<a href="#para_538">538</a>&#41;, it will be
time enough to dispense with his &#8220;pointing dead.&#8221; I
dwell upon this subject because many excellent dogs,
from not having been properly taught to &#8220;point dead,&#8221;
often fail in securing the produce of a successful shot,
while, on the contrary, with judiciously educated dogs it
rarely happens that any of the slain or wounded are
left on the field. Moreover, the protracted search and
failure &#40;as an instance see <a href="#para_314">314</a>&#41; occasions a lamentable
loss of time. Were a sportsman who shoots over dogs
not well broken to &#8220;point dead&#8221; &#40;or retrieve&#41; to calculate
accurately, watch in hand, he would, I think, be
surprised to find how many of his best shooting hours
are wasted in unprofitable searching for birds, of the
certainty of whose untimely fate his dogs had probably
long before fully convinced themselves.</p>

<div class="pageheader">WOODCOCK LOST.</div>

<p id="para_268"><span class="small">268. I was shooting some seasons back where woodcocks, being
scarce, are considered great prizes. If one is sprang, the pheasants
are immediately neglected, and every exertion is made to secure the
rara avis. We flushed one; at length it was killed; it fell in thick
cover,&mdash;was found by a setter &#40;a feather or two in his mouth
betraying him&#41;; but as the dog had not been properly taught to
&#8220;point dead,&#8221; we were obliged to leave the bird behind, after
spending nearly half an hour in a fruitless search.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BIRD KILLED,&mdash;DOG TO &#8220;HEEL.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_269">269. As to the word &#8220;Dead,&#8221; whether you choose to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
continue using it immediately after loading, or, as I
have recommended &#40;<span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_XI">xi</a></span>. of 141&#41;, <i>after a time</i> omit it, and
merely let the signal to &#8220;heel&#8221; intimate that you have
killed, always make your dog go to you before you
allow him to seek for the fallen bird.</p>

<p id="para_270">270. Some may say, &#8220;As a dog generally sees a bird
fall, what is the use of calling him to you before you let
him seek?&mdash;and even if he does not see the bird, why
should any time be lost? Why should not you and he
go as direct to it as you can?&#8221;</p>

<div class="pageheader">DEAD BIRDS LEFT ON GROUND.</div>

<p id="para_271">271. Provided you have no wish that the &#8220;finder&#8221;
&#40;see <a href="#para_541">541</a>&#41;, rather than any of his companions, should be
allowed the privilege of &#8220;seeking dead,&#8221; I must admit
that in the cultivated lands of England, when a dog
&#8220;sees a bird fall,&#8221; he might in nine cases out of ten go
direct to it without inconvenience. Even here, however,
there are occasions when intervening obstacles
may prevent your observing what the dog is about; and
in cover, so far from being able to give him any assistance
by signaling, you may be ignorant whether or not
he has seen the bird knocked over, or is even aware of
the general direction in which he ought to seek. But
in the oft-occurring cases in which &#8220;he does not see the
bird fall,&#8221; it is obvious &#40;particularly when he happens
to be at the extremity of his beat&#41;, that you will far
more quickly place him where you wish, if you make
him, at first, run up to you, and then advance from you,
straight to the bird, by your forward signal &#40;<a href="#para_277">277</a>&#41;. These
good results at least will follow, if you remain stationary,
and make him join you. You do not lose sight of the
spot where you marked that the bird or birds fell. The
foil is not interfered with by your walking over the
ground &#40;a matter of much importance, especially on
bad scenting days&#41;. The dog, if habituated to &#8220;seek&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
without your companionship, will readily hunt morasses
and ravines, where you might find it difficult to accompany
him. He will feel the less free to follow his own
vagaries; and this consciousness of subjection will
dispose him to pay more watchful attention to your
signals. He will the more patiently wait at the &#8220;down
charge;&#8221; and when you are reloaded will not be so
tempted to dash recklessly after the bird, regardless
whether or not he raises others on the way. If he is
dragging a cord, you can the more easily take hold of
its end, in order to check him, and make him point
when he first winds the dead bird,&mdash;and should you be
shooting over several dogs, by none of them being permitted
to run direct to the fallen bird, they will the
less unwillingly allow you to select the one who is to
approach close to you before &#8220;seeking dead.&#8221;</p>

<p id="para_272">272. The opponents of this method argue, that the
practice may give the dog the bad habit of running
immediately after the &#8220;down charge&#8221; to the gun, instead
of recommencing to hunt; particularly if he is shot over
by a first-rate performer. Granted; but is not the
temptation to bolt off in search of a dead bird still
stronger? To check the former evil, endeavour to make
the coming to &#8220;heel&#8221; an act of obedience rather than a
voluntary act, by never failing, as soon as you are reloaded,
to give the customary signal &#40;<span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_VIII">viii</a>.</span> of 141&#41; when
you have killed, or the signal to &#8220;hie on&#8221; should you
have missed.</p>

<p id="para_273">273. Moreover, you will sometimes meet with a dog
who, when a bird has been fired at, though it be the
first and only one sprung of a large covey, commences
&#8220;seeking dead&#8221; immediately after the &#8220;down charge,&#8221;
apparently considering that his first duty. This sad,
sad fault&mdash;for it frequently leads to his raising the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
other birds out of shot&mdash;is generally attributable to the
dog&#8217;s having been allowed to rush at the fallen bird,
instead of being, accustomed to the restraint of having
first to run up to the gun.</p>

<p id="para_274">274. To prevent your pupil from ever behaving so
badly, often adopt the plan of not &#8220;seeking dead&#8221; immediately
after loading, especially if the birds are lying
well. Mark accurately the spot where your victim lies,
and closely hunt for others, endeavouring to instil great
caution into the dog, much in the manner &#40;being guided
by his disposition and character&#41; described in <a href="#para_196">196</a>, <a href="#para_197">197</a>,
and <a href="#para_329">329</a>. As long as any of the covey remain unsprung,
you ought not to pick up one dead bird, though you
should have a dozen on the ground. Your dog ought
not even to &#8220;down charge&#8221; after you have fired, if he is
fully aware that more birds are before him. To impart
to him the knowledge that, <i>however important is the
&#8220;down charge,&#8221; his continuing at his point is still more
so</i>, you may, when the birds are lying well and he is at
a fixed point, make your attendant discharge a gun at
a little distance while you remain near the dog, encouraging
him to maintain his &#8220;toho.&#8221; If you have no
attendant, and the birds lie like stones, fire off a barrel
yourself while the dog is steadily pointing.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
He will fancy you see birds which he has not noticed, and, unless
properly tutored and praised by you, will be desirous
to quit those he has found, to search for the bird he
conceives you have shot.</p>

<p id="para_275">275. It is a fine display of intelligence in the dog,
and of judicious training in the breaker &#40;may it be your
desert and reward ere long to witness it in your pupil&#41;,
when a pointer &#40;or setter&#41; in goodly turnips or strong
potatoes draws upon birds which obligingly rise one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
after the other, while by continuing his eloquent attitude
he assures you that some still remain unsprung, to
which he is prepared to lead you, if you will but attend
to them and him, and, instead of pot-hunting after those
you have killed, wait until his discriminating nose informs
him that having no more strangers to introduce,
he is at liberty to assist you in your search.</p>

<div class="pageheader">POINT CONTINUED.</div>

<p id="para_276">276. To revert, however, to the point particularly
under discussion, viz., whether you prefer that your
dog go direct to the fallen bird, or &#40;as I strongly recommend&#41;
that he first join you, pray be consistent;
exact which you will, but always exact the same, if you
are anxious to obtain cheerful unhesitating obedience.</p>

<div class="pageheader">GOOD TRAINING EXEMPLIFIED.</div>

<p id="para_277"><span class="small">277. I have seen the advantage of the latter method very
strikingly exemplified in America, in parts of which there is capital
snipe-shooting. In the high grass and rushes on the banks of the
Richelieu, many a bird have I seen flushed and shot at, of which
the liver and white pointer, ranging at a little distance, has known
nothing. As he was well broken in, he, of course, dropped instantly,
on hearing the report of the gun. If the bird had fallen,
his master, after reloading, used invariably to say &#8220;Dead,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
in a low tone of voice, on which the dog would <i>go up to him</i>; and
then his master, without stirring from the spot where he had fired,
directed him by signals to the place where the bird fell, to reach
which the dog often had to swim the stream. His master then
said &#8220;Find.&#8221; At that word, and not before it, his intelligent
four-footed companion commenced searching for the bird, nor did
he ever fail to find and bring; and so delicate was his mouth
that I have often seen him deliver up a bird perfectly alive, without
having deranged a feather, though, very probably, he had
swam with it across one of the many creeks which intersect that
part of the country. If the shot was a miss, his master&#8217;s silence
after reloading, and a wave of his arm to continue hunting &#40;or the
command to &#8220;Hie on,&#8221; if the dog was hidden by the rushes&mdash;perhaps
a low whistle would have been better&#41;, fully informed his
companion of the disappointment. He was quite as good on the
large quail, and small woodcock found in Canada, which latter
makes a ringing noise on rising, not unlike the sound of a distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
soft bell; but reminiscences of that capital old dog are leading me
away from your young one.</span></p>

<p id="para_278">278. For some days you cannot shoot to your pupil
too steadily and quietly&mdash;I had well-nigh said too
slowly. By being cool, calm, and collected yourself,
you will make him so. I am most unwilling to think
that you will be too severe, but I confess I have my
misgivings lest you should occasionally overlook some
slight faults in the elation of a successful right and
left. Filling the game-bag must be quite secondary to
education. Never hesitate to give up any bird if its
acquisition interfere with a lesson. Let all that you
secure be done according to rule, and in a sportsmanlike
manner.</p>

<p id="para_279">279. It is proper you should be warned that you must
not always expect a dog will &#8220;toho&#8221; the first day as
readily as I have described, though most will, and some
&#40;especially pointers&#41; even more quickly, if they have
been previously well drilled, and have been bred for
several generations from parents of pure blood.</p>

<p><span class="small">I do not say bred in and in. Breeding in and in, to a certainty,
would enfeeble their intellects as surely as their constitutions. In
this way has many a kennel been deprived of the energy and endurance
so essential in a sportsman&#8217;s dog.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">EDUCATION BEFORE GAME-BAG.</div>

<p id="para_280"><span class="small">280. The late Lord Harris gave Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t</span> &#40;mentioned in <a href="#para_195">195</a>&#41;,
then residing in Essex, two young, very highly-bred pointer pups,
a brother and sister. Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t</span>, after some months, carried them
into Kent, and, without their having had the least preliminary
instruction, or ever having seen a bird, took them out partridge-shooting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
He had no older dog to set them a good example, and as
they were wholly unbroken, he feared they would bolt for home the
moment he squibbed off his gun; but, though they seemed much
astonished and extremely nervous at the report, great caressing and
encouragement induced them to remain. After awhile the dog
went forward, and sniffed about,&mdash;then he began to hunt,&mdash;at length
he did so very assiduously; but his sister not so keenly, for she did
little more than follow in his wake. Generally it is otherwise,
bitches being usually the earliest in the field. At length the dog
came to a stiff point at the edge of some turnips. The bitch perceived
him and timidly backed. Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t</span> hastened up&mdash;birds
arose&mdash;one fell, fortunately killed outright&mdash;the dog dashed at it,
and, tremulous with a world of new and pleasurable emotions,
nosed and fumbled it about in a very excited manner, but did not
attempt to gripe it. Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t</span>, lest he should damp the youngster&#8217;s
ardour, refrained from rating, or even speaking to him, but left
him entirely to himself. After a time, singular to say,&mdash;for he had
not been taught as a puppy to &#8220;fetch,&#8221;&mdash;he lifted the partridge,
and carried it to his master,&mdash;a practice he was afterwards allowed to
pursue. Is it not clear that, if he had been well instructed in the
initiatory lessons, Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;t</span> would have found him perfectly made
with the exception of having no systematic range? He turned out
extremely well, and constantly showed himself superior to his sister,
who always wanted mettle.</span></p>

<p>As in the present instance, it often occurs that a dog
is less inclined to dash in at first than when he is more
acquainted with birds. He is suddenly arrested by the
novelty of the scent, and it is not until he is fully
assured from what it proceeds that he longs to rush forward
and give chase. In autumnal breaking the dog
gets his bird&mdash;it is killed for him&mdash;he is satisfied&mdash;and
therefore he has not the same temptation to rush in as
when he is shown birds in the spring.</p>

<p id="para_281">281. If you find your dog, from excess of delight and
exuberance of spirits, less under general command than
from his initiatory education you had expected, and that
he will not &#8220;toho&#8221; steadily at the exact spot at which
you order him, at once attach a checkcord to his collar.
It will diminish his pace, and make him more cautious
and obedient. The moment you next see him begin to
feather, get up quickly, <i>but without running</i>, to the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of the cord, and check him with a sudden jerk if you
are satisfied that game is before him and that he ought
to be pointing. If from his attitude and manner you
are <i>positive</i> that there is game, drive a spike &#40;or peg&#41;
into the ground, and tie the cord to it. I only hope the
birds will remain stationary. If they do, you can give
him a capital lesson by remaining patiently alongside of
him, and then heading him and the birds in the manner
before described &#40;<a href="#para_264">264</a>, <a href="#para_265">265</a>&#41;.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SIGNALS TO ATTENDANT.</div>

<p id="para_282">282. As a general rule, an attendant or any companion
cannot be recommended, because he would be likely to
distract a young dog&#8217;s attention &#40;<a href="#para_10">10</a>&#41;; but an intelligent
fellow who would readily obey your signals, and not
presume to speak, would, doubtless, with a very wild
dog, be an advantageous substitute for the spike. You
could then employ a longer and slighter cord than usual,
and, on the man&#8217;s getting hold of the end of it, be at
once free to head and awe the dog. Whenever you had
occasion to stand still, the man would, of course, be as
immoveable as yourself.</p>

<p><span class="add2em">Your signals to him might be:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="add4em">The gun held up,&mdash;&#8220;Get near the dog.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="add4em">Your fist clenched,&mdash;&#8220;Seize the rope.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="add4em">Your fist shaken,&mdash;&#8220;Jerk the cord.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="add4em">Your hand spread open,&mdash;&#8220;Let go the cord.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Or any signs you pleased, so that you understood each
other without the necessity of speaking.</p>

<div class="pageheader">RANGE OF STOAT.</div>

<p id="para_283">283. Should it ever be your misfortune to have to
correct in a dog evil habits caused by past mismanagement,
such an attendant, if an active, observant fellow,
could give you valuable assistance, for he sometimes
would be able to seize the cord immediately the dog
began &#8220;feathering,&#8221; and generally would have hold of
it before you could have occasion to fire. But the fault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
most difficult to cure in an old dog is a bad habit of
ranging. If, as a youngster, he has been permitted to
beat as his fancy dictated, and <i>has not been instructed in
looking to the gun for orders</i>, you will have great, very
great difficulty in reclaiming him. Probably he will
have adopted a habit of running for a considerable distance
up wind, his experience having shown him that
it is one way of finding birds, but not having taught
him that to seek for them by crossing the wind would
be a better method.</p>

<p><span class="small">Curiously enough, nature has given this systematic range to the
stoat,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> though, happily for the poor rabbits, it cannot carry a high
nose, and therefore the parallels on which it hunts are necessarily
not far apart. This interesting proceeding is occasionally witnessed
by those keepers who injudiciously prefer their game-disturbing
guns to their vermin-destroying traps.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span></p>

<div class="pageheader">CHEETA AND ANTELOPES.</div>

<p id="para_284"><span class="small">284. The great advantage of teaching a dog to point the instant
he is sensible of the presence of birds &#40;<a href="#para_260">260</a>&#41;, and of not creeping a
foot further until he is directed by you, is particularly apparent
when birds are wild. While he remains steady, the direction of
his nose will lead you to give a tolerable guess as to their &#8220;whereabouts,&#8221;
and you and your companion can keep quite wide of the
dog &#40;one on each side&#41;, and so approach the birds from both flanks.
They, meanwhile, finding themselves thus intercepted in three directions,
will probably lie so close as to afford a fair shot to, at least, one
gun, for they will not fail to see the dog and be awed by his presence.
Raise your feet well off the ground, to avoid making a noise. Walk
quickly, but with no unnecessary flourish of arms or gun. They may
fancy that you intend to pass by them:&mdash;a slow cautious step often
raises their suspicions. &#40;Most sportsmen in the Highlands prefer a
low cap, or a wide-awake, to a hat; one of the motives for this
choice being that the wearer is less conspicuous,&mdash;not appearing so
tall. It is because he will not appear so tall that he thinks he can
get nearer to a pack by approaching the birds up hill, rather than
by coming down upon them from a height. Many an old sportsman
crouches when approaching wild birds.&#41; As soon as you and
your friend are in good positions, you can motion to the dog to
advance and flush the birds. You should on no account halt on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
way, for the moment you stop they will fancy they are perceived,
and take wing. It is by driving round and round, constantly contracting
the circle, and <i>never stopping</i>, that the bullock-cart, carrying
the trained cheeta, is often brought within 100 yards of the herd of
antelopes, amidst which is unsuspiciously browsing the doomed dark buck.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Driven directly towards the herd, the cart could not approach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
within thrice that distance. In Yorkshire, very late in the
season, when the grouse are so scared that they will not allow a dog
or man to get near them, it often happens that a good bag is made
by the gun keeping just ahead of a cart and horse. Here, however,
no circuit is made. The birds are found by chance. The only
dog employed is the retriever, kept in the cart until he is required
to fetch.</span></p>

<p id="para_285">285. You must not, however, too often try to work
round and head your pupil when he is pointing. Judgment
is required to know when to do it with advantage.
If the birds were running, you would completely throw
him out, and greatly puzzle and discourage him, for they
probably would then rise out of shot, behind you, if
they were feeding up wind,&mdash;behind him, if they were feeding down wind.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Far more frequently make him work out the scent by his own sagacity and nose, and
lead you up to the birds, every moment bristling more and more, at a pace<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
entirely controlled and regulated by your signals. These being given with your right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
hand will be more apparent to him if you place yourself
on his left side. It is in this manner that you give
him a lesson which will <i>hereafter</i> greatly aid him in
recovering slightly winged birds,&mdash;in pressing to a rise
the slow-winged but nimble-heeled rail,&mdash;or in minutely
following the devious mazes through which an old cock-pheasant,
or yet more, an old cock-grouse, may endeavour
to mislead him. And yet this lesson should not be given
before he is tolerably confirmed at his point, lest he
should push too fast on the scent; and make a rush
more like the dash of a cocker than the sober, convenient
&#8220;road&#8221; of a setter. As his experience increases
he will thus acquire the valuable knowledge of
the position of his game:&mdash;he will lead you to the
centre of a covey, or what is of greater consequence&mdash;as
grouse spread&mdash;to the centre of a pack, &#40;instead of
allowing himself to be attracted to a flank by some
truant from the main body&#41;, and thus get you a good
double shot, and enable you effectually to separate the
birds:&mdash;he will, moreover, become watchful, and sensible
of his distance from game&mdash;a knowledge all-important,
and which, be it remarked, he never could gain in turnips
or potatoes, or any thick cover.</p>

<p id="para_286"><span class="small">286. Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, well known in Edinburgh, told me
that a black and tan pointer of his &#40;Admiral <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;y&#8217;s</span> breed&#41; gave,
on one occasion, a very clever proof of his knowledge of the distance
at which he ought to stand from his game. He was ranging in thick
stubble. Some partridge, being slightly alarmed, rose a little above
the ground, and then dropped very near the dog,&mdash;upon which the
sagacious creature instantly crouched close to the ground, his head
between his fore-legs, and in that constrained position <i>ventre-&agrave;-terre</i>,
pushed himself backwards until he had retreated to what he conceived
to be a judicious distance from the covey, when he stood up
and pointed boldly.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">VEXATIOUS STANCHNESS.</div>

<p id="para_287">287. There is another and yet stronger reason why
you should not consider it a rule always to head your
young dog at his point. You may&mdash;although at first it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
seems an odd caution to give&mdash;make him too stanch.
This, to be sure, signifies less with partridges than with
most birds; but if you have ever seen your dog come
to a fixed point, and there, in spite of all your efforts,
remain provokingly immoveable&mdash;plainly telling you of
the vicinity of birds, but that you must find them out
for yourself&mdash;your admiration of his steadiness has, I
think, by no means reconciled you to the embarrassing
position in which it has placed you. I have often witnessed
this vexatious display of stanchness, although
the owner cheered on the dog in a tone loud enough to
alarm birds two fields off.</p>

<p id="para_288">288. A keeper will sometimes praise his dog for such
stanchness; but it is a great fault, induced probably by
over-severity for former rashness,&mdash;and the more difficult
to be cured, if the animal is a setter, from the crouching
position which he often naturally assumes when pointing.</p>

<div class="pageheader">INSTANCES OF FINE ROADING.</div>

<p id="para_289"><span class="small">289. A friend of mine was told by Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;t</span> &#40;to whom those
interested in the prosperity of the Edinburgh Zoological Gardens
ought to feel much indebted&#41;, that a little pointer bitch of his came,
on a hot, dry, bad scenting day, to a fixed point. He could not
persuade her to move, nor could he or his friend spring any game;
and two not bad-nosed dogs that were hunting with her would not
acknowledge the scent, even when they were brought close to the
bitch. As she would neither advance nor retire, he actually had
her carried off in a boy&#8217;s arms. When she was put down, away she
ran and resumed her point. After another ineffectual attempt to
raise birds, again she was borne off, but only to take up for a <i>third</i>
time her point. At length, after a yet closer search&mdash;in which,
however, she still refused to join,&mdash;a young blackcock was perceived
closely buried under a thick piece of heather. The very excellence
of the bitch&#8217;s nose, and her admirable perseverance, made it the
more vexatious that she had not been taught the meaning of the
signals to advance. One grieves that anything should have been
neglected in the education of so superior a creature.</span></p>

<p id="para_290">290. I advised &#40;<a href="#para_285">285</a>&#41; your practising your young dog in &#8220;footing&#8221;
out a scent. Though it occurred many years ago, I remember as if
it were but yesterday &#40;from my annoyance at shooting so execrably,
when it was peculiarly incumbent on me not to miss&#41;, my nearly
making a sad mistake with a very young dog, who was following up
a retreating bird most magnificently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p id="para_291"><span class="small">291. I was looking for grouse where I thought that there might
be some, but was sure there could not be many. After beating for
a considerable time unsuccessfully, the youngest of the dogs that
were hunting made a stanch point. I got up to him;&mdash;nothing rose.
I encouraged him to press on. He did so, and at a convenient pace
which allowed me to keep parallel with him. He so seldom stopped,
and bristled so little, that I thought he was making a fool of me.
Still, as he now and then looked round sagaciously, as if to say
&#8220;There really is game ahead,&#8221; I did not like to tell him of my
suspicions. Though my patience was sorely tried, for he led me a
distance which I dare not name, I resolved to let him have his
own way, and to see what would be the result, satisfied that undue
precipitance on my part might effect more evil than could arise from
an erroneous participation in his proceedings. At length, when my
good resolutions were all but exhausted, and I was thinking of
chiding the dog for his folly, we approached a bare spot, free from
heather:&mdash;up sprung a noble cock-grouse, challenging splendidly.</span></p>

<p id="para_292"><span class="small">292. I had been so perplexed, and was, I am ashamed to say, so
unnerved, that, though the bird went off in a line directly from me,
I missed him with both barrels; I don&#8217;t know when I was more
vexed:&mdash;nothing but my bungling lost the young dog the reward he
so richly deserved.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<div class="pageheader">OVER-CAUTION.</div>

<p id="para_293">293. I recount this story, though it is little in my
favour, to warn you against the too common error of
fancying that a young dog is making false points if
birds do not get up directly. They may have taken
leg-bail, and thus have puzzled him in his inexperience.
Dogs not cowed by punishment will, after a little hunting,
seldom make false points, while they are unfatigued.
To a certainty they will not draw upon a false point for
any distance: therefore, never punish what is solely
occasioned by over-caution. Your doing so would but
increase the evil. Self-confidence and experience are
the only cures for a fault that would be a virtue if not
carried to excess. Even a good dog will occasionally
make a point at larks from over-caution when birds are
wild; but see the first note to <a href="#para_194">194</a>.</p>
<p id="para_294">294. After you have shot over a dog a short time, his
manner and attitude will enable you to guess pretty accurately
whether birds are really before him; whether
they are far off or near; and whether or not they are
on the move. Generally speaking, the higher he carries
his head, and the less he stiffens his stern, the further
off are the birds. If he begin to look nervous, and become
fidgety, you will seldom be wrong in fancying they
are on the run. But various, and at times most curious,
are the methods that dogs will adopt, <i>apparently</i> with
the wish to show you where the birds are, and <i>certainly</i>
with the desire to get you a shot.</p>

<p id="para_295"><span class="small">295. A pointer, belonging at the present moment to a nobleman
in Perthshire, Lord <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;d</span>, &#40;from whose lips my informant heard
the strange story&#41;, has quite a novel mode of telling that birds are
on the move. While they continue quiet, he points them in the usual
manner, with his head towards them, but so soon as they begin to
walk off, he directly faces about, very disrespectfully presenting his
stern to them,&mdash;whether to express contempt for their want of courtesy,
or to warn his lordship to look out for a long shot, I will leave you to decide.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
I particularly inquired if he did this indifferently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
whether the birds were running up or down wind. This my informant
could not positively tell. All he knew was that his lordship
had said, in a general way, that the singularly mannered animal
invariably repeated this eccentric proceeding whenever the birds
moved.</span></p>

<p id="para_296"><span class="small">296. Not only will a dog&#8217;s manner often show you whether or not
birds are on the move, but his carriage, when you are accustomed
to him, will frequently tell you what species of game is before him.
I know an old pointer that is capital in light cover. His owner
shoots rabbits over him, and whenever the dog finds one, though he
points steadily, his tail vibrates as regularly as a pendulum.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">FIRST BLACKCOCK.</div>

<p id="para_297"><span class="small">297. Years ago, when I was shooting in the North, I was crossing
some land which the encroachments of husbandry had converted
from wild heather to profitable sheep-walks; suddenly a young dog
that was with me came to a more rigid point than I had ever
seen him make&mdash;every muscle appeared distended&mdash;I was puzzled&mdash;I
felt satisfied that he had winded something very unusual, but
what to expect I could not imagine, for there seemed not cover for
a tomtit. When I got up to him he was so nervously anxious that
I had some difficulty in making him advance, but at length he
slowly brought me towards a small bush, to which he nailed his
nose. Further he would not proceed. I kicked the bush; when,
to my great gratification, up gradually rose a young blackcock,
which went off to killing distance with a flight not more rapid than
that of the florikin. It was the first black game that the dog had
ever seen. It was also the first that I had ever seen on the wing,
and this may account for all the attendant circumstances being so
strongly impressed upon my memory.</span></p>

<p id="para_298"><span class="small">298. Colonel <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, on the staff of the Duke of <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, told
me that about ten years ago he heard a gentleman, then living on
the Mall at Birr, make a bet of a pony &#40;he offered to wager a much
larger sum&#41; that his terrier bitch would point all the kinds of game
found in the neighbouring bog&mdash;and further, that before it was sprung
he would name what description of game the dog was pointing.
The gentleman won his bet handsomely, though they found snipe,
woodcock, grouse, hare, and something else,&mdash;as well as Colonel
<span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;n</span> now remembers,&mdash;a duck. It was soon evident to the spectators,
that the attitude of the clever animal&mdash;short-eared, with a
considerable cross of the bull-dog&mdash;varied according to the nature
of the game she came across. To an English ear shooting on a bog
does not sound very attractive,&mdash;but though the walking is generally
difficult, the sport is often interesting, from the variety of game the
sportsman frequently meets with.</span></p>

<p id="para_299">299. After a few trials you will, I hope, be able to
dispense with the peg recommended in <a href="#para_281">281</a>, and soon
after with the checkcord also. But if your dog possesses
unusually high spirits, or if he travels over the ground
at a pace which obviously precludes his making a proper
use of his nose, it may be advisable to fasten to his
collar a bar, something like a diminutive splinter-bar,
that it may, by occasional knocking against his shins,
feelingly admonish him to lessen his stride. If he gets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
it between his legs and thus finds it no annoyance,
attach it to both sides of his collar from points near
the extremities. One of his fore-legs might occasionally
be passed through the collar; but this plan is not so
good as the other; nor as the strap on the hind-leg &#40;<a href="#para_60">60</a>&#41;.
These means &#40;to be discarded, however, as soon as obedience
is established&#41; are far better than the <i>temporary</i>
ascendancy which some breakers establish by low diet
and excessive work, which would only weaken his
spirits and his bodily powers, without eradicating his
self-will, or improving his intellects. You want to force
him, when he is in the highest health and vigour, to
learn by experience the advantage of letting his nose
dwell longer on a feeble scent.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BAR. FRENCH SPIKE-COLLAR.</div>

<p id="para_300">300. I have made no mention of the spiked-collar,
because it is a brutal instrument, which none but the
most ignorant or unthinking would employ. It is a
leather collar into which nails, much longer than the
thickness of the collar have been driven, with their
points projecting inwards. The French spike-collar is
nearly as severe. It is formed of a series of wooden
balls,&mdash;larger than marbles,&mdash;linked &#40;about two and a
half inches apart&#41; into a chain by stiff wires bent into
the form of hooks. The sharp pointed hooks punish
cruelly when the checkcord is jerked.</p>

<div class="pageheader">ENGLISH SPIKED-COLLAR.</div>

<p id="para_301">301. We have, however, a more modern description
of collar, which is far less inhuman than either of those I
have mentioned, but still I cannot recommend its adoption,
unless in extreme cases; for though not so severely,
it, likewise, punishes the unfortunate dog, more or less,
by the strain of the checkcord he drags along the ground:
and it ought to be the great object of a good breaker as
little as is possible to fret or worry his pupil, that all his
ideas may be engaged in an anxious wish to wind birds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
On a leather strap, which has a ring at one end, four
wooden balls &#40;of about two inches diameter&#41; are threaded
like beads, at intervals from each other and the ring,
say, of two inches &#40;the exact distance being dependent
on the size of the dog&#8217;s throat&#41;. Into each of the
balls sundry short thickish pieces of wire are driven,
leaving about one-sixth of an inch beyond the surface.
The other end of the strap &#40;to which the checkcord is
attached&#41; is passed through the ring. This ring being
of somewhat less diameter than the balls, it is clear,
however severely the breaker may pull, he cannot compress
the dog&#8217;s throat beyond a certain point. The
effect of the short spikes is rather to crumple than
penetrate the skin.</p>

<p id="para_302">302. I have long been sensible of the aid a spiked-collar
would afford in reclaiming headstrong, badly educated
dogs, if it could be used at the moment&mdash;and only
at the precise moment&mdash;when punishment was required;
but not until lately did it strike me how the collar could
be carried so that the attached cord should not constantly
bear upon it, and thereby worry, if not pain the
dog. And had I again to deal with an old offender,
who incorrigibly crept in after pointing, or obstinately
&#8220;rushed into dead,&#8221; I should feel much disposed to
employ a slightly spiked collar in the following manner.</p>

<p id="para_303">303. That the mere carrying the collar might not
annoy the dog, I would extract or flatten the nails fixed
on the <i>top</i> of the collar, on the part, I mean, that would
lie on the animal&#8217;s neck. This collar I would place on
his neck, in front of his common light collar. I would
then firmly fasten the checkcord, in the usual way, to
the spiked-collar; but, to prevent any annoyance from
dragging the checkcord, at about five or six inches from
the fastening just made I would attach it to the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
collar, with very slight twine&mdash;twine so slight that,
although it would not give way to the usual drag of the
checkcord, however long, yet it would readily break on
my having to pull strongly against the wilful rush of an
obstinate dog, when, of course, the spikes would punish
him, as the strain would then be borne by the spiked-collar alone.</p>

<p id="para_304">304. Guided by circumstances, I would afterwards
either remove the spiked-collar, or, if I conceived another
bout necessary, refasten the checkcord to the common
collar with some of the thin twine, leaving, as before,
five or six inches of the checkcord loose between the
two collars.</p>

<p id="para_305">305. If you should ever consider yourself forced to
employ a spiked-collar, do not thoughtlessly imagine
that the same collar will suit all dogs. The spikes for
a thin-coated pointer ought to be shorter than for a
coarse-haired setter! You can easily construct one to
punish with any degree of severity you please. Take a
common leather collar; lay its inner surface flat on a
soft deal board: through the leather drive with a hammer
any number of tacks or flat-headed nails: then get
a cobbler to sew on another strap of leather at the back
of the nails, so as to retain them firmly in position.</p>

<div class="pageheader">DOG NOT NOTICING BIRDS.</div>

<p id="para_306">306. I have supposed that your dog has <i>scented</i> the
birds before they rose, but if he spring them without
having previously noticed them &#40;as in some rare cases
happens even to well-bred dogs&#41; you <i>must</i> bring him
back to the spot at which you feel assured that he ought
to have been sensible of their presence, and <i>there</i> make
him &#8220;Toho.&#8221; Afterwards endeavour to make him aware
of the haunt by encouraging him to sniff at the ground
that the birds have just left. The next time watch very
carefully for the <i>slightest</i> indication of his feathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and then instantly call out &#8220;Toho.&#8221; After a few times
he will, to a certainty, understand you.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BIRD RUN TO WINDWARD.</div>

<p id="para_307">307. You should kill outright the few first birds at
which you fire. I would infinitely prefer that you
should miss altogether, than that one of the two or three
first birds should be a runner. Afterwards you have
full leave to merely wing a bird; but still I should wish
it not to be too nimble. This is a good trial of <i>your</i>
judgment as well as the dog&#8217;s. I hope he is to leeward
of the bird, and that it will not catch his eye. See he
touches on the haunt. Do not let him work with his
nose to the ground. &#8220;Up, up,&#8221; must be your encouraging
words &#40;or &#8220;On, on,&#8221; according to circumstances&#41;, whilst
with your right hand &#40;<span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_IV">iv</a>.</span> of 141&#41; you are alternately
urging and restraining him, so as to make him advance
at a suitable pace. From his previous education, not
being flurried by any undue dread of the whip, he will
be enabled to give his undisturbed attention, and devote
all his faculties to follow unerringly the retreating bird.
But from inexperience he may wander from the haunt.
On perceiving this, bring him, by signals, back to the
spot where he was apparently last aware of the scent.
He will again hit it off. If you view the bird ever so
far ahead, on no account run. I hope you will at length
observe it lie down. Head it, if possible, and strike it
with your whip, if you think you will be unable to
seize it with your hand. Endeavour to prevent its
fluttering away;&mdash;it is too soon to subject the youngster
to such a severe trial of his nerves and steadiness. Then,
&#40;having put the poor creature out of its misery, by
piercing its skull, or rapping its head against your gun,&#41;
as before &#40;<a href="#para_266">266</a>&#41;, show your dog the gratifying prize which
your combined exertions have gained.</p>

<p id="para_308">308. Should he unluckily have caught sight of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
running bird, and, in spite of all your calls, have rushed
forward and seized it, you ought to have proceeded as
described in <a href="#para_322">322</a>. Clearly, however, you would not have
dragged the dog back to the place where he &#8220;down
charged,&#8221; but merely to the spot from which he had made
his unlawful rush. If the bird had been very active, it
would have been far better to have fired at it a second
time &#40;while it was running&#41;, than to have incurred the
risk of making your dog unsteady by a wild pursuit.
Suppose that it was not winged, but rose again on your
approaching it, and fluttered off,&mdash;a hard trial for the
young dog,&mdash;you must, however, have made him bear
it, and obey your loud command to &#8220;drop,&#8221;&mdash;you would
&#40;or should&#41; have taken another shot, and have proceeded
in exactly the same manner as if this had been your
first find &#40;<a href="#para_265">265</a>, <a href="#para_266">266</a>&#41;.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BIRD RUN TO LEEWARD.</div>

<p id="para_309">309. As the wounded bird was to windward of the
dog, the course to follow was obvious,&mdash;it was plain
sailing; but the case would have varied greatly if the
dog had been to windward. Had you pursued the usual
plan, he must have roaded the bird by the &#8220;foot;&#8221; and
the danger is, that in allowing him to do so you may
create in him the evil habit of hunting with his nose
close to the ground, which is above all things to be
deprecated. You have another mode&mdash;you can &#8220;lift&#8221;
the dog &#40;I suppose you know the meaning of that hunting
term&#41;, and make him take a large circuit, and so
head the bird, and then proceed as if it had fallen to
windward.</p>

<div class="pageheader">PERSEVERE IN SEEKING.</div>

<p id="para_310">310. The latter plan would avoid all risk of your
making him a potterer, and it is, I think, to be recommended
if you find him naturally inclined to hunt low.
But the former method, as a lesson in &#8220;footing,&#8221; must
be often resorted to, that he may learn unhesitatingly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
distinguish the &#8220;heel&#8221; from the &#8220;toe,&#8221; and how to push
an old cock-grouse, or to flush a pheasant running
through cover, or the red-legged, I was nearly saying,
the everlasting-legged partridge;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
and, indeed, generally, how to draw upon his birds, and with confidence lead
you to a shot when they are upon the move and running
down wind. &#40;See end of <a href="#para_115">115</a>; and for further directions,
and for &#8220;seeking dead&#8221; with two dogs, look at
<a href="#para_544">544</a>&#41;. The heavy Spanish pointer, from his plodding
perseverance and great olfactory powers, was an excellent
hand at retrieving a slightly injured bird on a
broiling, bad scenting day.</p>

<p id="para_311">311. When I advised you &#40;<a href="#para_266">266</a>&#41; to let the dog &#8220;have
plenty of time to make out the bird,&#8221; I spoke from personal
experience, and from a vivid recollection of errors
committed in my novitiate. A young hand is too apt
to imagine that every bird which falls to his gun is
killed outright, and lying dead on the spot where it fell.
He will, therefore, often impatiently, and most injudiciously,
call away the dog who, at a little distance,
may have hit off the trail of the winged bird, and be
&#8220;footing&#8221; it beautifully.</p>

<p id="para_312">312. If in these lessons you should fail in obtaining one
or two wounded birds, though it might not be a matter of
any moment to yourself personally, it would be extremely
vexatious on the dog&#8217;s account, because, in this early
stage of his education, it would tend to discourage him.
The feeling which you must anxiously foster in him is
this, that after the word &#8220;Find&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
the search must never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
be relinquished, even though he be constrained to hunt
from morning till night. And it is clear that to make
an abiding, valuable impression, this lesson must be
inculcated on the several first occasions with unremitting,
untiring diligence.</p>

<div class="pageheader">ALLOW HIM TO &#8220;NOSE.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_313">313. Persevere, therefore, for an hour, rather than
give up a wounded bird. Join in the search yourself.
Even if you see where it lies, do not pick it up hastily.
On the contrary, leave it, but mark well the spot. Keep
on the move. Hold your gun as if in expectation of a
rise. Pretend to seek for the bird in every direction,
even for a good half hour, if you can encourage your
dog to hunt so long. If, indeed, you see him flag, and
get wearied and dispirited, gradually bring him close,
but to leeward of the spot where the bird lies, in order
to make him &#8220;point dead,&#8221; and be rewarded for all his
diligence by finding it himself. Let him, also, have a
good sniff at it and nose it &#40;but let there be no biting
or mouthing&#41;, before you put it into the bag. Otherwise,
what return has he for the pains he has taken?</p>

<div class="pageheader">SEARCH FOR HOURS.</div>

<p id="para_314">314. It is no conclusive argument against the practice
of allowing him to &#8220;nose,&#8221; that many first-rate dogs
have never been so indulged. It is certain that they
would not have been worse if they had; and many a
dog, that would otherwise have been extremely slack,
has been incited to hunt with eagerness from having
been so rewarded. There are dogs who, from having
been constantly denied all &#8220;touseling,&#8221; will not even
give themselves the trouble of searching for any bird
which they have <i>seen</i> knocked over, much less think
of pointing it. They seem satisfied with this ocular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
evidence of its death; for, odd to say, these very dogs
will often zealously obey the order to hunt for any bird
whose fall they have not noticed; but in winding it
they will indulge in no more than a passing sniff,&mdash;which
sniff, unless you are watchful, you may not observe,
and so lose your bird. Never fail, therefore, to
let your pupil ruffle the feathers<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> a little, while you
bestow on him a caress or a kind word of approbation.
You then incite to perseverance, by, even with dogs, a
very abiding motive,&mdash;&#8220;self-interest;&#8221; but mind the
important rule, that this &#8220;nosing&#8221; be only <i>when</i> the
bird is in your possession, not <i>before</i> it is in your possession.
If you wish to establish for ever a confirmed
perseverance in &#8220;seeking dead,&#8221; you must sacrifice <i>hours</i>
&#40;I say it seriously&#41; rather than give up any of the first
wounded birds. Be persuaded that every half hour
spent in an unremitting search for <i>one</i> bird, if ultimately
successful, will more benefit the young dog than your
killing a <i>dozen</i> to him, should you bag them the moment
you are reloaded. Of course you would not, when you
are giving such a lesson in perseverance, fire at another
bird, even if it sprang at your feet,&mdash;for your doing so,
whether you missed or killed, would unsettle the young
dog, and make him relinquish his search. Be stimulated
to present exertion by the conviction that if he be not
<i>now</i> well instructed, you must expect him to lose, season
after season, nearly every bird only slightly disabled by
a merely tipped wing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p id="para_315"><span class="small">315. I casually asked Mr. <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;h</span> what kind of sport he had
had in Aberdeenshire with Sir <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;m</span> <span class="glue">F&mdash;&mdash;n</span>. He replied, &#8220;The
pleasantest imaginable. One day we killed forty-six brace, and
bagged every feather. Indeed, <span class="glue">F&mdash;&mdash;n</span> never loses a bird. I have
actually known him, when his dogs were young, spend a full half
hour in hunting for a dead bird; nothing would induce him to give
up. The consequence is, that <i>now</i> he never loses one by any chance.
He broke in the dogs entirely himself:&mdash;he would seldom allow his
keeper to say a word to them. He was always very patient; and
he is well rewarded for his trouble.&#8221; Why not take the same trouble
and obtain a like reward? This was <i>true</i> sport! What battue-shooting
could compare with it?</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">LOAD BEFORE YOU BAG.</div>

<p id="para_316">316. I hope you will not say, as would most of our neighbours
<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
on the other side of the Channel: &#8220;But if,
instead of waiting to load, I had gone after the winged
bird just as it fell, when first I saw it start off running,
the evil you have now spoken of &#40;<a href="#para_312">312</a>&#41; could not have
occurred, for there would have but been little risk of losing
it.&#8221; Probably not, but you would have almost ruined
your dog; and to secure this one bird, in all likelihood
you would subsequently lose a hundred.
<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
How could you with justice blame him if, when next you killed, he
rushed headlong after the bird &#40;instead of dropping
patiently to the &#8220;down charge&#8221;&#41;, and so sprung a dozen
birds while you were unloaded?</p>

<p id="para_317">317. Perhaps you will say, &#8220;You tell me to fire at a
running bird, but when a winged cock-pheasant or red-legged
partridge is racing off <i>out of shot</i>, how am I to
get it, if I proceed in the slow, methodical manner you
advise? May it not lead me an unsuccessful dance for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
an hour, if I do not allow the dog to start ahead and
seize?&#8221; It may, &#40;but I hope months will pass before you
witness such agility&#41;; and this shows that those who do
not employ a retriever, and yet are sticklers for a setter&#8217;s
&#40;or pointer&#8217;s&#41; never being permitted to touch a feather,
must on such occasions get into a dilemma; and, unless
they are willing to lose the bird, must plead guilty to the
inconsistency of being pleased&mdash;however loudly they may
roar out &#8220;Toho,&#8221; &#8220;ware dead,&#8221;&mdash;when they see their dog,
in defiance of all such calls, disable it by a sudden grip.
This plan, though frequently followed, cannot be correct.
They blame the dog for doing what they really wish,
and if he be too tender-mouthed to injure the bird, he
keeps them at top speed, while he is alternately picking
up the unfortunate creature, acting on his natural impulses,&mdash;and
letting it fall on being rated. I therefore
repeat, that even if you do not wish your dog constantly
to retrieve &#40;<a href="#para_536">536</a>&#41;, you would still act judiciously in
teaching him as a puppy to fetch &#40;<a href="#para_96">96</a>&#41;, for then he will
give chase to the winged bird, and bring it to you <i>on
getting the order</i>, instead of permitting it to escape for a
fresh <i>burst</i>, or carrying it off, as I have seen done. You
thus maintain discipline. The dog will do what you
wish, in obedience to orders,&mdash;not in opposition to orders.
The sticklers for dogs never being allowed to nose a
feather, ought, unless they are willing to give up slightly
winged birds, not to shrink from the difficult task
of teaching their pupils to stop and retain with their
paws &#40;<a href="#para_319">319</a>&#41;.</p>

<div class="pageheader">PERSEVERANCE INSTANCED.</div>

<p id="para_318"><span class="small">318. The pertinacity with which some dogs will &#8220;seek dead&#8221; is
really surprising. A relative of mine had an English pointer which
was so devoted to hunting for &#8220;knocked-down&#8221; birds, that she was
almost unequalled in &#8220;finding,&#8221; though in other respects possessed of
very ordinary qualifications. If she failed in soon winding the lost
bird, she would of her own accord make a large circuit; and if still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
unsuccessful, she would indefatigably traverse the field from leeward
until some slight taint in the atmosphere intimated to her in what
direction to continue the search. When he afterwards hunted her
in Ireland, though he could not get her to point snipe, yet if he
killed one, she would exert herself to the utmost to retrieve it. Her
keenness probably in part arose from her having, as a young one,
always been indulged with a good &#8220;touseling&#8221; of the game before
it was picked up. She never wished to grip.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BIRD HELD BY PAW.</div>

<p id="para_319"><span class="small">319. A gentleman who was my neighbour a few seasons ago, has
a very old setter, which was also capital at &#8220;finding.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8221; used
to lay his paw upon the wounded bird, which, I fancy, afforded him
such gratification that he would zealously devote every faculty he
possessed to secure the prize. You could not teach every dog this
method of detaining a bird. If yours is one of a very docile disposition
you may effect it by always placing the dead or wounded
bird for a minute or two under his paw before you deposit it in
the bag.</span></p>

<p id="para_320"><span class="small">320. An officer of the Navy, Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;b</span>, of Southsea, once possessed
a true Blenheim&mdash;naturally a tender breed&mdash;that, from having
been injudiciously thrown into the water when young &#40;see <a href="#para_104">104</a>&#41;, had
taken such a dislike to the element, that although she was extremely
attached to her master, and always anxious to be with him, especially
when he shouldered his gun, yet the moment she saw him appear
with a towel in hand &#40;feeling assured he purposed bathing&#41;, she would
bolt off, and allow nothing to persuade her to accompany him.
Now, great as was her abhorrence of a cold bath, yet her gratification
in retrieving so far outweighed every other feeling, that for the
moment it overcame her aversion to a plunge, and whenever Mr.
<span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;b</span> shot a duck she would dash in to bring it on shore. She
would carefully deposit it at the edge of the bank, but not carry it
a step further. &#8220;Rose&#8221; had secured it, and that was the extent of
her wishes.</span></p>

<p id="para_321">321. We have only spoken of instances <a href="#para_266">266</a>, <a href="#para_307">307</a>, <a href="#para_309">309</a>,
in which all has gone on smoothly, the dog most obediently
dropping to shot and permitting <i>you</i> to take up
the bird notwithstanding the poor creature&#8217;s death-struggles.
Suppose, however, and this may probably
happen, that he does not restrain himself at the &#8220;down
charge,&#8221; but, in spite of all your calls and signals, rushes
forward, yet yields to your menaces and halts in mid-career.
It is well&mdash;your course is clear; you have to
lug him back, and threaten, and lecture him. But should
he not check himself until he sniffs the game, his stop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
then becomes a &#8220;point;&#8221; and if he is of a timid disposition,
or has ever evinced any disposition to blink, you
dare not force him to retrace his steps, lest he should
mistake your motives, and fancy himself encouraged to
abandon his point. If you merely make him &#8220;down
charge,&#8221; you violate the axiom named in <a href="#para_359">359</a>. In short,
you are in a difficulty. It is a nice case, in which your
own judgment of the dog&#8217;s character can alone decide
you.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BIRD SEIZED.</div>

<p id="para_322">322. But, if from inadequate initiatory instruction&mdash;for
I will maintain that such marked rebellion can arise
from no other cause&mdash;in the excitement of the moment
he actually rushes in and seizes the bird, he must be
punished, I am sorry to say it; but however much we
may deplore it, <i>he must</i>; for he has been guilty of great
disobedience, and he well knows that he has been disobedient.
But the temptation was strong, perhaps too
strong for canine nature,&mdash;that is to say, for canine nature
not early taught obedience. The wounded bird was
fluttering within sight and hearing:&mdash;it was, too, the first
he had ever seen,&mdash;and this is almost his first glaring
act of disobedience: be merciful, though firm. Make
him &#8220;drop.&#8221; Get up to him at once. Probably he will
relinquish his grip of the bird; if not, make him give
it up to you, but do not pull it from him: that would
only increase the temptation to tear it. Lay it on the
ground. Then drag him back to the spot from which
he rushed; there make him lie down. Rate him. Call out &#8220;Toho.&#8221;
<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Crack the whip over him&mdash;and, I am
pained to add, make use of it&mdash;but moderately, not
severely. Three or four cuts will be enough, provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
he has not torn the bird; if he has, his chastisement
must be greater. Let him now have one nibble without
punishment, and soon a whole carcass will not suffice
for his morning&#8217;s meal. Do not strike him across the
body, but lengthwise.</p>

<div class="pageheader">PUNISHMENT HOW ADMINISTERED.</div>

<p id="para_323">323. An ill-tempered dog might attempt to bite you.
Prevent the possibility of his succeeding, by grasping
and twisting his collar with your left hand, still keeping
him at the &#8220;down.&#8221; Consider coolly whether you are
flagellating a thick-coated dog, or one with a skin not
much coarser than your own. Pause between each cut;
and that he may comprehend why he is punished, call
out several times, but not loudly, &#8220;Toho&mdash;bad&mdash;toho,&#8221;
and crack your whip. Let your last strokes be milder
and milder, until they fall in the gentlest manner&mdash;a
manner more calculated to awaken reflection than give
pain. When the chastisement is over, stand close in
front of him, the better to awe him, and prevent his
thinking of bolting. Put the whip quietly into your
pocket, but still remain where you are, occasionally
rating him and scolding him while you are loading;
gradually, however, becoming milder in manner, that he
may be sensible that, though your dissatisfaction at his
conduct continues, his punishment is over &#40;<a href="#para_342">342</a> to <a href="#para_347">347</a>&#41;.
Indeed, if you have any fear of his becoming too timid,
you may at length fondle him a little, provided that
while you so re-encourage him, you continue to say
&#8220;Toho&mdash;toho,&#8221; most impressively&mdash;then, giving him the
wind, go up together to the bird, and make him &#8220;point
dead&#8221; close to it. Take it up, and let him fumble the
feathers before you loop it on the bag.</p>

<div class="pageheader">PART GOOD FRIENDS.</div>

<p id="para_324">324. Never let a dog whom you have been forced to
chastise bolt or creep away until you order him. If he
is ever allowed to move off at <i>his</i> wish, he will improve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
upon the idea, and on the next occasion will far too soon
anticipate <i>yours</i>. And do not send him off, until he has
given some evidence of having forgiven you, and of his
desire to be reconciled, by crawling towards you, for
instance, or wagging his tail. On no occasion&mdash;under
circumstances of ever such great provocation&mdash;be so
weak or irritable &#40;but I hope you do not need the
warning&#41; as to give him a kick or a blow when he is
going off. He ought to have stood with reassured confidence
alongside of you, for perhaps a minute or so,
before you sanctioned his departure; and the severer
his punishment the longer should have been the detention.
You are always to part tolerable friends, while he
feels perfectly convinced that his chastisement is over.
If you do not, you may find it rather difficult to catch
him when he commits another fault. It will be owing
to your own injudiciousness if he ever become afraid of
approaching you after making a blunder. Should he be
so, sit down. He will gradually draw near you; then
quietly put your hand on his collar.</p>

<p id="para_325">325. If a man cannot readily get hold of any dog
under his tuition whom he desires to rate or punish,
you may be certain that he fails either in temper or
judgment; perhaps in both. He may be an excellent
man, but he cannot be a good dog-breaker. There are
men who get quite enraged at a dog&#8217;s not coming instantly
to &#8220;heel&#8221; on being called. When at length the
poor brute does come within reach, he gets a blow, perhaps
a licking&mdash;a blow or licking, he has the sense to
see he should have longer avoided had he stayed longer
away. Thus the punishment increases instead of remedying
the evil.</p>

<div class="pageheader">PROOF BEFORE PUNISHMENT.</div>

<p id="para_326">326. Never correct or even rate a dog, in the mere
<i>belief</i> that he is in error; be first <i>convinced</i> of his guilt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
If you have good reason to suspect that, unseen by you,
he has wilfully sprung birds, still rather give him an
earnest caution than any severer rebuke. It is not easy
to repair the mischief occasioned by unjust punishment.
When from his sheepish look, or any other cause, you
imagine that he has raised game, either through heedlessness,
or from their being unusually wild, be sure to give
him a short lecture, and accompany him to the haunt.
A lingering bird may occasionally reward you. If his
manner has led you to form an incorrect opinion, your
warning can have no other effect than to increase his
caution &#40;rarely an undesirable result&#41;; and if you are
right, the admonition is obviously most judicious.</p>

<p id="para_327">327. Let me caution you against the too common
error of punishing a dog by pulling his ears. It has
often occasioned bad canker. Some men are of opinion
that it is frequently the cause of premature deafness.
When you rate him you may lay hold of an ear and
shake it, but not with violence.</p>

<p id="para_328">328. I would strongly recommend you always to
make your young dog &#8220;drop&#8221; for half a minute or so,
when he sees a hare; or when he hears a bird rise.
<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
To effect this, stand still yourself. After a few seconds
you can either hie him on, or, which is yet better, get
close to him if you expect other birds to spring. You
will thus, especially in potatoes or turnips, often obtain
shots at birds which would have made off, had he continued
to hunt, and early in the season be frequently
enabled to bag the tail-bird of a covey. This plan will
also tend to make him cautious, and prevent his getting
a habit of blundering-up birds, and cunningly pretending
not to have noticed their escape. It will also make him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
less inclined to chase hares and rabbits, or rush at a
falling bird.</p>

<div class="pageheader">LESSON IN TURNIPS.</div>

<p id="para_329">329. On approaching a piece of turnips, you may
have heard, &#8220;Let us couple up all the dogs excepting
Old Don;&#8221; the veteran&#8217;s experience having shown him,
that the only effect of his thundering through them
would be to scare every bird and make it rise out of
shot. <i>You</i>, on the contrary, when your pupil is well
confirmed in his range, and has some knowledge of his
distance from game, ought to wish the other dogs kept
to &#8220;Heel&#8221; &#40;especially when the seed has been broadcast&#41;,
that by the word &#8220;Care&#8221; and the hand slightly
raised, you may instil into him the necessary caution,
and so, by judicious tuition, give him the benefit of your
own experience. Most probably you would be obliged to
employ the checkcord
<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
which I presume to be always at hand ready for occasional use. Or you
might strap your shot-belt round his throat, for it is essential that
he traverse such ground slowly, and greatly contract his range, &#40;see
<a href="#para_197">197</a>&#41;. The several cross scents he will encounter should afford him a
valuable lesson in detecting the most recent, and in discriminating
between the &#8220;heel and toe&#8221; of a run. Be patient,&mdash;give him
time to work and consider what he is about. It is
probable that he will frequently overrun the birds
on their doubling back, and imagine that they are
gone. Should he do so, bring him again on the spot
where he appeared to lose the scent. He now rushes
up the adjacent drill. &#8220;Slower, slower,&#8221; signals your
right arm; &#8220;go no faster than I can walk comfortably.&#8221;
On the other hand, the birds may lie like stones. Not
until you have remained nearly a minute alongside of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
him let him urge them to rise; and make him effect
this, not by a sudden dash, but by steadily pressing on
the scent. Bear in mind, as before warned &#40;<a href="#para_193">193</a>&#41;, that
the confidence with which he can here creep on to a
near find may lead, if he is now mismanaged, to his
springing on future occasions, from want of care, many
a bird at which he ought to get you a shot.</p>

<div class="pageheader">LESSON IN &#8220;GONE.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_330">330. If you can contrive it, let your pupil have some
little experience in the field before you give him a <i>real</i>
lesson in &#8220;Gone&#8221; &#40;or &#8220;Flown&#8221;&#41;. Instead of being
perplexed, he will then comprehend you. Should you,
therefore, during the first few days of hunting him, see
birds make off, in lieu of taking him to the haunt &#40;as
many breakers erroneously do&#41;, carefully keep him
from the spot. You cannot let him run riot over the
reeking scent without expecting him to do the same
when next he finds; and if, in compliance with your
orders, he points, you are making a fool of him&mdash;there
is nothing before him; and if he does not fancy you as
bewildered as himself, he will imagine that the exhilarating
effluvia he rejoices in is the sum total you both
seek. This advice, at first sight, may appear to contradict
that given in <a href="#para_132">132</a> and <a href="#para_306">306</a>; but look again, and
you will find that those paragraphs referred to peculiar
cases. Should your young dog be loitering and sniffing
at a haunt which he has <i>seen</i> birds quit, he cannot well
mistake the meaning of your calling out, &#8220;Gone, gone.&#8221;</p>

<div class="pageheader">KILLING RABBITS REPROBATED.</div>

<p id="para_331">331. Probably you may be in a part of the country
where you may wish to kill hares to your dog&#8217;s point.
I will, therefore, speak about them, though I confess I
cannot do it with much enthusiasm. Ah! my English
friend, what far happier autumns we should spend
could we but pass them in the Highlands! Then we
should think little about those villanous hares &#40;<a href="#para_338">338</a>&#41;.
We should direct the whole <i>undivided</i> faculties of our
dogs, to work out the haunt of the noble grouse.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
for rabbits, I beg we may have no further acquaintance,
if you ever, even in imagination, shoot them to your
young dog. Should you be betrayed into so vile a
practice, you must resign all hope of establishing in
him a confirmed systematic range. He will degenerate
into a low potterer,&mdash;a regular hedge-hunter. In
turnips he will always be thinking more of rabbits than
birds. It will be soon enough to shoot the little
wretches to him when he is a venerable grandfather.
The youngster&#8217;s noticing them &#40;which he would be
sure to do if you had ever killed one to him&#41; might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
frequently lead to your mis-instructing him, by earnestly
enforcing &#8220;Care&#8221; at a moment when you ought to rate
him loudly with the command &#8220;Ware&#8221; &#40;or &#8220;No&#8221;&#41;.
But to our immediate subject.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SHOOTING HARES.</div>

<p id="para_332">332. Defer as long as possible the evil day of shooting
a hare over him, that he may not get too fond &#40;<a href="#para_69">69</a>&#41; of
such vermin&mdash;I beg pardon, I mean game&mdash;and when
you do kill one, so manage that he may not see it put
into the bag. On no account let him mouth it. You
want him to love the pursuit of feather more than of
fur, that he may never be taken off the faintest scent of
birds by coming across the taint of a hare. I therefore
entreat you, during his first season, if you will shoot
hares, to fire only at those which you are likely to kill
outright; for the taint of a wounded hare is so strong
that it would probably diminish his zeal, and the sensitiveness
of his nose, in searching for a winged bird.</p>

<p id="para_333">333. The temptation is always great to quit for a
strong scent of hare &#40;which any coarse-nosed dog can
follow&#41;, a feeble one of birds; therefore it is a very
satisfactory test of good breaking to see a dog, when he
is drawing upon birds, in no way interrupted by a hare
having just crossed before him. If you aim at such
excellence, and it is frequently attained in the Highlands,
it is certain you must not shoot hares over your
youngster.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_212" id="ill_212"></a>
<img src="images/ill_212.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="385" />
<p class="caption">THE FIRST COURSE.</p>
</div>

<div class="pageheader">OFF AFTER HARE.</div>

<p id="para_334">334. I hope that he will not see a hare before you
have shot a few birds over him. The first that springs
up near him will test the perfection to which he has
attained in his initiatory lessons. Lose not a moment.
It is most essential to restrain instantaneously the
naturally strong impulse of the dog to run after four-footed
game. Halloo out &#8220;Drop&#8221; to the extent of your
voice,&mdash;raise your hand,&mdash;crack your whip,&mdash;do all you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
can to prevent his pursuing. Of course you will not
move an inch. Should he commence running, thunder
out &#8220;No,&#8221; &#8220;no.&#8221; If, in spite of everything, he bolts
after the hare, you have nothing for it but patience.
It is of no use to give yourself a fit of asthma by
following him. You have only half as many legs as he
has,&mdash;a deficiency you would do well to keep secret
from him as long as possible. Wait quietly where you
are&mdash;for an hour if necessary. You have one consolation,&mdash;puss,
according to her usual custom, has run
down wind,&mdash;your dog has lost sight of her, and is, I
see, with his nose to the ground, giving himself an
admirable lesson in roading out a haunt. After a time
he will come back looking rather ashamed of himself,
conscious that he did wrong in disobeying, and vexed
with himself from having more than a suspicion forced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
upon him, that he cannot run so fast as the hare.
When he has nearly reached you, make him &#8220;drop.&#8221;
Scold him severely, saying, &#8220;Ware chase&#8221; &#40;a command
that applies to the chase of birds as well as of hares&#41;.
Pull him to the place where he was when first he got a
view of the hare,&mdash;make him lie down,&mdash;rate him well,&mdash;call
out &#8220;No,&#8221; or &#8220;Hare,&#8221; or &#8220;Ware chase,&#8221; or any
word you choose, provided you uniformly employ the
same. Smack the whip and punish him with it, but
not so severely as you did when we assumed that he
tore the bird &#40;end of <a href="#para_322">322</a>&#41;. You then flogged him for
two offences: first, because he rushed in and seized the
bird; secondly, because he tore it and <i>tasted</i> blood.
If you had not then punished him severely, you could
never have expected him to be tender-mouthed. On
the next occasion he might have swallowed the bird,
feathers and all.</p>

<div class="pageheader">CHECKCORD.</div>

<p id="para_335">335. Should he persist in running after hares, you
must employ the checkcord. If you see the hare, at
which he is pointing, in its form, drive a peg firmly
into the ground, and attach the cord to it, giving him a
few slack yards, so that after starting off he may be
arrested with a tremendous jerk. Fasten the line to
the part of the spike close to the ground, or he may
pull it out.</p>

<p id="para_336">336. I have known a dog to be arrested in a headlong
chase by a shot fired at him:&mdash;an act which you will
think yet more reprehensible than the previous mismanagement
for which his owner apparently knew no
other remedy than this hazardous severity.</p>

<p id="para_337">337. When you are teaching your dog to refrain from
chasing hares, take him, if you can, where they are
plentiful. If they are scarce, and you are in the neighbourhood
of a rabbit-warren, visit it occasionally of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
evening. He will there get so accustomed to see the
little animals running about unpursued by either of
you, that his natural anxiety to chase fur, whether it
grow on the back of hare or rabbit, will be gradually
diminished.</p>

<div class="pageheader">MOUNTAIN-HARES.</div>

<p id="para_338">338. In Scotland there are tracts of heather where
one may hunt for weeks together and not find a hare;
indeed, it is commonly observed, that hares are always
scarce on those hills where grouse most abound. In
other parts they are extremely numerous. Some sportsmen
in the Highlands avail themselves of this contrasted
ground, in order to break a young dog from
&#8220;chasing.&#8221; They hunt him, as long as he continues
fresh, where there are no hares; and when he becomes
tired, they take him to the Lowlands, where they are
plentiful. By then killing a good many over him, and
severely punishing him whenever he attempts to follow,
a cure is often effected in two or three days. In the
yet higher ranges, the mountain-hares,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> from possessing
a peculiarly strong scent, and not running to a distance,
are a severe trial to the steadiest dog.</p>

<p><span class="small">In the autumn they are nearly blue; in the winter white; and in
some counties are now found in marvellous quantities. The greater
pains taken of late years to destroy all kinds of vermin, has much
tended to their increase. A few seasons ago a party at Lord
<span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;d&#8217;s</span>, in Perthshire, killed seven hundred in one day. The
plan adopted was for a large body of men and boys to surround a
hill at its base, and beating slantingly upwards, to drive all the
hares before them. The sportsmen, who formed part of the ascending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
cordon, obtained many shots; but the principal slaughter was
reserved for the guns previously posted on the top. There is, however,
little sport or fun in such stationary, wholesale butchery,
beyond the excitement of competition, and not being able to load
fast enough. The doomed animals, being solely attentive to the
movements of their assailants below, come trooping upwards, and
are mostly knocked over whilst sitting on their haunches, listening
to the unusual sounds made by the approaching beaters.</span></p>

<p id="para_339">339. Killing a sitting hare to your dog&#8217;s point will
wonderfully steady him from chasing; but do not fire
until he has remained stanch for a considerable time.
This will show him that puss is far more likely to be
bagged by <i>your</i> firing, than by <i>his</i> pursuing.</p>

<p id="para_340">340. For the same object,&mdash;I mean, to make your
young dog stanch,&mdash;I would recommend your killing a
few birds on the ground to his point, were it not that
you rarely have the opportunity.</p>

<div class="pageheader">RETRIEVING WOUNDED HARE.</div>

<p id="para_341">341. When you have made your dog perfectly steady
from chasing, you may &#40;supposing you have no retriever
at hand&#41;, naturally enough, inquire how you are to
teach him to follow any hare you may be so unlucky
as merely to wound. I acknowledge that the task is
difficult. I would say, at once resolve to give up every
wounded hare during his first season.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The following
year, provided you find that he remains quite steady, on
your wounding an unfortunate wretch, encourage your
dog to pursue it by running yourself after it. When he
gets hold of it, check him if he mauls it, and take it
from him as quickly as possible. As I cannot suppose
that you are anxious to slaughter every hare you see,
let the next two or three go off without a shot. This
forbearance will re-steady him, and after a while his
own sagacity and nose &#40;<a href="#para_545">545</a>&#41; will show him that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
established usage was departed from solely, because
puss was severely struck.</p>

<div class="pageheader">CUTS FEW BUT SEVERE.</div>

<p id="para_342">342. As you wish to flog your dog as little as possible,
never go out without your whip, paradoxical as this may
appear. The dog&#8217;s salutary awe of the implement
which he sees in your possession, like a horse&#8217;s consciousness
of your heel being armed with a spur, will
tend to keep him in order. If the dog is a keen ranger,
you may much spare the whip by making him crouch
at your feet for several minutes after he has committed
a fault. The detention will be felt by him, when he is
all anxiety to be off hunting, as a severe punishment.
If he is a mettlesome, high-couraged animal, he will
regard, as a yet severer punishment, his being compelled
to follow at your heels for half-an-hour, while the other
dogs are allowed the enjoyment of hunting.</p>

<p id="para_343"><span class="small">343. Captain <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;l</span>, &#40;son of the celebrated shot&#41;, was in the
stubbles in &#8217;50 with some friends, who were anxious to see how
their own dogs hunted. He, therefore, had his favourite pointer
taken up and led by an attendant. This first-rate animal, who is
passionately devoted to the sport, struggled so violently to get free,
that he actually foamed at the mouth. After a time he was uncoupled;
when, instead of hunting as usual, he raced over the field,
quartering his ground most systematically, and designedly springing
all the birds. Quite useless was every halloo and threat, whether
of voice or whip;&mdash;stop he would not, as long as there was a feather
in the field. Satisfied then with the mischief he had done, he sat
down by the hedge, quietly awaiting any punishment that might be
awarded him. His master, however, feeling persuaded that the dog
had only acted from the impulse of momentary passion, and with
the intention of avenging the unusual indignity to which he had
been subjected, merely reproached him for his misconduct, and
allowed him to hunt the next field, which he did as steadily as
ever. This was somewhat similar to &#8220;Captain&#8217;s&#8221; behaviour &#40;<a href="#para_492">492</a>&#41;.</span></p>

<p id="para_344">344. Excess of punishment has made many a dog
of good promise a confirmed blinker; and of far more
has it quenched that keen ardour for the sport, without
which no dog can be first-rate. For this reason, if
not from more humane motives, make it a rule to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
give but few cuts; let them, however, be tolerably
severe. Your pupil&#8217;s recollection of them, when he
hears the crack of the whip, will prevent the necessity
of their frequent repetition.</p>

<div class="pageheader">BIRDS&#8217; FEET GIVEN.</div>

<p id="para_345"><span class="small">345. I knew of a young fellow&#8217;s purchasing a pointer of an excellent
breed from a gamekeeper for a <i>few shillings</i> merely, as the
animal had become so timid from over-chastisement, that she not
only blinked her game, but seldom quitted the man&#8217;s heels.</span></p>

<p>The lad had the good sense to treat the bitch, at all
times, with the greatest kindness; and in order to induce
her to hunt, he used to break off the feet<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> of every
bird he killed, and give them to her to eat along with
the sinews. The plan succeeded so well that she eventually
became an unusually keen and fast ranger. This
would be a hazardous step to take with a dog wanted
to retrieve. There are few, if any dogs who may not
be tempted by hunger to eat game. A gentleman told
me, that, to his great astonishment, he one day saw an
old tender-mouthed retriever, that he had possessed for
years, deliberately swallow a partridge. Before he could
get up to the dog even the tail-feathers had disappeared.
On inquiry it turned out that, through some neglect,
the animal had not been fed.</p>

<div class="pageheader">CHASTISEMENT OF DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_346">346. Some argue that blinking arises from a defective
nose, not from punishment; but surely it is the injudicious
chastisement following the blunders caused by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
a bad nose that makes a dog, through fear, go to &#8220;heel&#8221;
when he winds birds. A bad nose may lead to a dog&#8217;s
running up birds from not noticing them, but it cannot
<i>naturally</i> induce him to run away from them. Possibly
he may be worthless from a deficiency in his olfactory
powers; but it is hard to conceive how these powers
can be improved by a dread of doing mischief when he
finds himself near game. Some dogs that have been
unduly chastised do not even betray themselves by
running to &#8220;heel,&#8221; but cunningly slink away from their
birds without giving you the slightest intimation of their
vicinity. I have seen such instances. When a young
dog, who has betrayed symptoms of blinking, draws
upon birds, <i>head</i> him, if you can, before you give him
the order to &#8220;toho:&#8221; he will then have such a large
circuit to make, that he will feel the less tempted to run
to your heels.</p>

<p id="para_347">347. Obedience and intelligence are, as I have already
remarked, best secured by judicious ratings and encouragements,&mdash;scoldings
for bad conduct,&mdash;praise,
caresses, and rewards for good. Never forget, therefore,
to have some delicacy in your pocket to give the
youngster whenever he may deserve it. All dogs, however,
even the most fearful, ought to be made able to
bear a little punishment. If, <i>unfortunately</i>, your dog
is constitutionally timid &#40;I cannot help saying <i>unfortunately</i>,
though so many of the sort have fine noses&#41;,
the whip must be employed with the greatest gentleness,
the lash being rather laid on the back than used,
until such forbearance, and many caresses before his
dismissal, have gradually banished the animal&#8217;s alarm,
and ultimately enabled you to give him a very slight
beating, on his misconducting himself, without any
danger of making him blink. By such means, odd as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
it may sound, you <i>create</i> courage, and with it give him
self-confidence and range.</p>

<div class="pageheader">DOG JUDICIOUSLY PUNISHED.</div>

<p id="para_348">348. A judiciously educated dog will know as well as
you do whether or not he has earned a chastisement,
and many a one is of so noble a nature that he will not
wish to avoid it if he is conscious that he deserves it.
He will become as anxious for good sport as you are,
and feel that he ought to be punished, if from his own
misconduct he mars it. Indeed, he will not have much
opinion of your sagacity if you do not then give him
a sound rating, or let him have a taste of the lash,
though it matters not how slight. Clearly this feeling,
which it will be right to foster, must have arisen from
his belief that you are always conscious of his actions
&#40;<a href="#para_383">383</a>&#41;; therefore never check him for coming towards
you on his committing any unseen error. Moreover,
when he has been but a little shot to, you will find that
if you abstain from firing at a bird which through his
fault he has improperly flushed, although in its flight
it affords you an excellent shot, you will greatly vex
him; and this will tend to make him more careful for
the future.</p>

<p id="para_349">349<span class="small">. Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;n</span> &#40;<a href="#para_286">286</a>&#41; had a pointer who would at once
give up hunting if he was not properly chastised on committing
a fault;&mdash;but what is far more extraordinary, and strongly shows
the varied, and occasionally <i>odd</i> dispositions of dogs, he would
never hunt keenly until from birds rising wildly &#40;or from some other
cause&#41; an <i>excuse</i> arose for giving him a flogging. After receiving the
punishment he would start off in the greatest spirits, and range
with uncommon ardour and perseverance. An excuse was, however,
quite indispensable; for, if from a good-humoured desire to gratify
his apparent longings he was favoured beforehand with a thrashing,
he would consider himself imposed on, and forthwith run home.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BACKING TAUGHT.</div>

<p id="para_350">350. When, after a few weeks, you perceive that the
youngster has confidence in himself, and is likely to
hunt independently, not deferentially following the footsteps
of an older companion, take out a well broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
dog with him, that you may have the opportunity of
teaching him to &#8220;back.&#8221; Be careful to choose one not
given to make false points; for if he commit such mistakes,
your pupil will soon utterly disregard his pointing.
Select also one who draws upon his birds in a fine,
determined attitude; not one to whose manner even
<i>you</i> must be habituated to feel certain he is on game.
Be watchful to prevent your dog ever hunting in the
wake of the other, which, in the humility of canine
youth, he probably will, unless you are on the alert
to wave him in a different direction, the moment you
observe him inclined to seek the company of his more
experienced associate. By selecting a slow old dog,
you will probably diminish the wish of the young one
to follow him; for it is likely that the youngster&#8217;s
eagerness will make him push on faster, and so take
the lead.</p>

<p id="para_351">351. The example for a <i>few</i> days &#40;but only for a few
days&#41; of a good stanch dog who is not a hedge-hunter,&mdash;has
no bad habits, and does not require being called
to,&mdash;will be advantageous to your inexperienced animal;&mdash;as
an instance:</p>

<div class="pageheader">GOOD EXAMPLE ADVANTAGEOUS.</div>

<p id="para_352"><span class="small">352. On one occasion, when I was abroad, I lent a favourite dog
to a young friend who had requested the services of the animal for
his kennel, not the field. I much objected to any person&#8217;s shooting
over the dog except myself, particularly as it was only his second
season. Therefore, very knowingly as I thought, I sent him on a
Saturday evening, having obtained a promise that he should be
returned to me early on Monday morning&mdash;and so he was; the lad,
however, had done me; for he confessed, many months afterwards,
that he could not resist the temptation of taking out my pointer
snipe-shooting on the intermediate Sunday along with his little
liver-coloured bitch;&mdash;and with a glowing countenance he observed
that he never had been so enchanted, for his young lady seeing her
fond companion drop instantly the gun was fired, and remain immoveable
until &#8220;hied on,&#8221; sedulously imitated him throughout the
day. It was the making of her,&mdash;but as it was the first time in
her young life she had ever behaved steadily, there was a great
risk of my pointer&#8217;s being much injured; for, alas! like poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
mortals, dogs are more prone to follow a bad example<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> than a good
one. We are, however, wandering.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BACKING.</div>

<p id="para_353">353. On the old dog&#8217;s pointing, catch the eye of the
young one. If you cannot readily do so, and are not
afraid of too much alarming the birds, call to the old
fellow by name, and desire him to &#8220;toho.&#8221; The order
will make the young one look round, and awaken him
to a suspicion of what is going forward. Hold up your
right arm,&mdash;stand still for a minute,&mdash;and then, carrying
your gun as if you were prepared momentarily to fire,
retreat, or move sideways in crab-like fashion towards
the old dog, continuing your signal to the other to
remain steady, and turning your face to him, so that he
may be restrained by the feeling that your eye is constantly
fixed upon him. He will soon remark the
attitude of the old dog, and almost intuitively guess its
meaning. Should the old one draw upon his game, still
the other dog must remain stationary. If he advance but
an inch, rate him. Should he rush up &#40;which is hardly
to be expected&#41;, at him at once;&mdash;having made him
drop, catch hold of him, and drag him to the place at
which he should have backed,&mdash;there &#40;if you judge such
strong measures necessary&#41; peg him down until after
you have had your shot and are reloaded. If by heading
the birds you can drive them towards the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
dog, do so; and aim at the one most likely to fall near
him. Endeavour to make him comprehend that any
sign or word to urge on or retard the leading dog, in no
way applies to him. This he will soon understand if he
has been properly instructed with an associate in the
initiatory lesson described in &#40;<a href="#para_49">49</a>&#41;. After you have
picked up the bird let him sniff at it.</p>

<p id="para_354">354. It is most important that the dog which first
winds birds should be allowed to &#8220;road&#8221; them to a
spring without being flurried, or in any way interfered
with by another dog. Few things are more trying to
your temper as a sportsman, than to see a self-sufficient
cub, especially when birds are wild, creep up to the
old dog whom he observes pointing at a distance, or
cautiously drawing upon a covey. The young whipper-snapper
pays no attention to your most energetic signals:
you are afraid to speak lest you should alarm the birds,
and before you can catch hold of the presumptuous
jackanapes, he not only steals close to the good old dog,
but actually ventures to head him; nay, possibly dares
to crawl on yet nearer to the birds in the hope of enjoying
a more intoxicating sniff.</p>

<div class="pageheader">POINT BY NOSE, NOT EYE.</div>

<p id="para_355">355. All dogs but the &#8220;finder&#8221; should stand wholly
by sight,&mdash;just the reverse of pointing. Your dog&#8217;s nose
ought to have nothing to do with backing. If you permit
it, he will get the abominable habit of creeping up
to his companions in the manner just described &#40;<a href="#para_354">354</a>&#41;,
when he observes them to be winding birds; and though
he may not presume to take the lead, nay, even keep at
so respectful a distance as in no way to annoy the
&#8220;finder,&#8221; yet a longing to inhale the &#8220;grateful steam&#8221;
&#40;as that good poet and capital sportsman, Somerville,
terms it&#41; will make him constantly watch the other
dogs, instead of bestowing his undivided attention and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
faculties upon finding game for himself. It is quite
enough if he backs whenever you order him, or he
accidentally catches sight of another dog either &#8220;pointing&#8221;
or &#8220;roading;&#8221; and the less he is looking after his
companions, the more zealously will he attend to his
own duties.</p>

<p id="para_356">356. If you have any fears that the old dog when he
is on birds will not act steadily, should you have occasion
to chide the young one, be careful to give the old
dog a word expressive of your approval, before you commence
to rate the other.</p>

<p id="para_357">357. When your youngster is hereafter hunted in
company, should he make a point, and any intrusive
companion, instead of properly backing him, be impertinently
pressing on, the youngster should not be
induced &#40;however great may be the trial upon his
patience and forbearance&#41; to draw one foot nearer to the
game than his own knowledge of distance tells him is
correct; not even if his friend, or rather, jealous rival,
boldly assumes the front rank. Your pupil will have
a right to look to you for protection, and to expect that
the rash intruder, however young, be <i>at the least</i> well
rated.</p>

<p id="para_358">358. It is a matter of little moment whether the
&#8220;backer&#8221; attends to the &#8220;down charge,&#8221; or continues to
back as long as the other dog remains at his point. It
appears, however, best, that he should &#8220;drop,&#8221; unless he
is so near that he winds the game, when he would be
rather pointing than backing &#40;and should, consequently,
behave as explained in <a href="#para_274">274</a>&#41;; for the fewer exceptions
there are to general rules the more readily are the
rules observed.</p>

<div class="pageheader">IMPORTANT AXIOM.</div>

<p id="para_359">359. Should both dogs make separate points at the
same moment, it is clear that neither can back the other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
They must act independently&mdash;each for himself. Moreover,
your firing over one should not induce the other
to &#8220;down charge,&#8221; or in any way divert his attention
from his own birds. He ought to remain immoveable
as a statue. Some dogs, whose high courage has not
been damped by over-correction, will do this from their
own sagacity; but to enable you to <i>teach</i> them to behave
thus steadily, game should be plentiful. When you are
lucky enough to observe both dogs pointing at the same
time, let your fellow-sportsman &#40;or your attendant&#41; flush
and fire at the birds found by the older dog, while
you remain stationary near the young one, quietly but
earnestly cautioning him to continue firm. When your
companion has reloaded and picked up his game &#40;and
made the other dog &#8220;back&#8221;&#41;, let him join you and knock
over the bird at which your pupil is pointing. It will
not be long before he &#40;your young dog&#41; understands
what is required of him, if he has been practised &#40;as
recommended in <a href="#para_274">274</a>&#41; not to &#8220;down charge&#8221; when
pointing unsprung birds. In short, it may be received
as an axiom, that <i>nothing ought to make a dog voluntarily
relinquish a point so long as he winds birds; and nothing
but the wish to continue his point should make him neglect
the &#8220;down charge&#8221; the instant he hears the near report
of a gun</i>.</p>

<p id="para_360"><span class="small">360. &#8220;Dove,&#8221; &#40;the setter spoken of in <a href="#para_102">102</a>, who invariably stands
at her point,&#41; on one occasion in the season of &#8217;50 dropped as usual
on her master&#8217;s firing at some distance from her; but, instead of
&#8220;seeking dead&#8221; as ordered when he had reloaded, she remained
immoveable at the &#8220;down charge,&#8221; although repeatedly coaxed and
called to. The sportsman thought that birds must be near, and
after much perseverance, he succeeded in <i>walking</i> up a brace that
were lying close to her. We must allow that this was a prettily
<i>conceived</i> piece of caution on the part of Mrs. &#8220;Dove;&#8221; but how
far more usefully would she have acted had she been taught the

almost invariably hunt too many dogs together. This
arises, I suppose, from the number which they have to

<p id="para_363">363. A glimmering of knowledge may be picked up
in this way; but no one will argue that it is likely to
create great excellence. Doubtless the young ones will
be good backers; and to the inexperienced a troop of
perhaps a dozen dogs, all in chiselled form, stanchly
backing an old leader, is a most imposing sight, but if
the observer were to accompany the whole party for a

the rear would do nothing but &#8220;back&#8221; and &#8220;down
charge.&#8221; What can they know of judicious quartering?
Of obeying the signals of the hand? Of gradually
drawing upon the faintest token of a scent &#40;only perceptible
to a nose carried high in the air&#41; until they
arrive at a confident point? Of perseveringly working
out the foil of a slightly winged bird, on a hot still day,
to a sure &#8220;find?&#8221; Nothing, or next to nothing,&mdash;nearly
all is to be taught; and yet the breaker will show off
those raw recruits as perfectly drilled soldiers. Would
they not have had a much better chance of really being
so, if he had given a small portion of his time each day
to each? He well knows they would; but the theatrical
display would not be half so magnificent. If he had
truly wished to give his pupils a good systematic range,
without a doubt he would have devoted one hour in the
field exclusively to each dog, rather than many hours to
several at once&mdash;and not have associated any together
in the field until he had gained full command over each
separately. And this he would have done &#40;<i>because it
would have tended to his interest</i>&#41;, had he supposed that
his dog&#8217;s qualifications would be investigated by judges,&mdash;by
those who would insist on seeing a dog hunted
singly &#40;in order to observe his method of ranging&#41;, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with but one companion, before they thought of definitively
purchasing.</p>

<div class="pageheader">GOOD QUALITIES.</div>

<p id="para_364"><span class="small">364. The good qualities of a horse being principally derived from
nature, a judge can pretty accurately discover his general capabilities
simply by a glance at his make and action;&mdash;but the good qualities
of a sportsman&#8217;s dog are chiefly derived from art; consequently,
though his movements may be light and springy,&mdash;his countenance
intelligent,&mdash;his nostrils wide,&mdash;his cerebral development large,&mdash;his
forehand deep,&mdash;his ribs round and full,&mdash;his elbows well detached
from them, not tied in,&mdash;his shoulders high, and slanting
backwards,&mdash;his loins muscular and arched,&mdash;his quarters lengthy,
and sinewy,&mdash;his legs bony, and straight,&mdash;his feet small and round,
pointing direct to the front,&mdash;his tail taper to the finest point from
a strong root,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> yet if he has been improperly shot over as a youngster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
he may never be worth his keep. Therefore, though a man
may in five minutes decide upon purchasing the horse, he would act
very imprudently if he ventured upon buying the dog before he had
seen him hunted;<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> unless indeed he feels well-justified confidence
in the ability of the party who broke him in, and is also satisfied
with the character, as a sportsman, of the person who has since shot
over him.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">NOSE&mdash;HOW JUDGED OF.</div>

<p id="para_365"><span class="small">365. No dog can be worth a large sum, or should be considered
<i>perfectly made</i>, that cannot be hunted in perfect silence,&mdash;that is
not good at finding dead or wounded birds, and that is not sure to
point them when found. If in his transverse range he keep his
head to windward it is a good sign, for it evinces his consciousness
that it is in the breeze he should seek for an intimation of the
vicinity of game. As to the excellence of his nose, this can only
be fully ascertained by experience, and by comparing him in the
field with other dogs; but some opinion may be formed by observing
whether on first winding game he confidently walks up to his point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
with a high head, or is shuffling in an undecided manner to the right
and left &#40;perhaps even pottering with his nose near the ground&#41;,
before he can satisfy himself respecting the exact locality of the
birds. There are favourable days when any dog can wind game,
when finding many birds will far more depend upon &#8220;range&#8221; than
nose. The surest way to test the olfactory powers of different dogs
is to take them out directly after mid-day in sultry weather, or
when a north-easterly wind has been blowing for some days. If
their condition, &amp;c. is then alike, you may be certain that the dog
who winds most birds has the finest &#40;or most cautious?&#41; nose. On
such a day chance will but little assist him.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SETTER&#8217;S GOOD NOSE.</div>

<p id="para_366"><span class="small">366. On an extremely bad scenting day in October, 1838, a cold
dry wind blowing from the east, the Hon. <span class="glue">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>, Baron A.
and Sir F. <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>, then partridge-shooting at <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, in Staffordshire,
saw a liver-coloured pointer take every point from three setters
of some celebrity belonging to a very sporting baronet. The setters
did not make a single &#8220;set&#8221; throughout the day, but ran into the
birds as if they had been larks. The pointer&#8217;s nose was, however,
so good that the party, notwithstanding the badness of the scent,
bagged thirty-five brace.</span></p>

<p id="para_367"><span class="small">367. The keeper who brought out the setters was obliged to own,
that he could not otherwise account for the apparent singularity of
their behaviour, than by admitting the superiority of the pointer&#8217;s
nose; yet, judging from the <a href="#ill_230_tb">engraving</a>, he did not carry his head
well.</span></p>

<p id="para_368"><span class="small">368. A stiffish price had been given for the dog, but I need hardly
say that it was not considered unreasonable, after the exhibition of
scenting-powers so unusual, fairly tested in the field with competitors
of established character.</span></p>

<p id="para_369"><span class="small">369. In this instance it was a pointer that evinced singular tenderness
of nose; but in the following, a setter bore off the palm in
a contest with good pointers. Mr. <span class="glue">Q&mdash;&mdash;r</span>, of <span class="glue">F&mdash;&mdash;w</span> &#40;county of
Suffolk&#41;, who is an enthusiast about shooting, three years ago took
out his favourite dog, a heavy, large-limbed, liver-coloured setter, on
a cold, raw, bad scenting day, together with a brace of pointers of
high character belonging to another Suffolk sportsman, Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;s</span>.
The latter had expressed rather a contemptuous opinion of the
setter, whose appearance was undeniably not very prepossessing;
but to the gentleman&#8217;s astonishment, and perhaps somewhat to his
mortification, the lumbering dog found plenty of birds, though there
was so little scent that the vaunted pointers were nearly useless. I
was told, that at that moment Mr. <span class="glue">Q&mdash;&mdash;r</span> would not have taken
two hundred guineas for the animal.</span></p>

<p id="para_370"><span class="small">370. What a pity it is that more pains are not taken to link in
matrimonial chains dogs of the rare excellence of nose described in
the preceding paragraph, and in <a href="#para_182">182</a>, <a href="#para_204">204</a>, and <a href="#para_289">289</a>, instead of being
satisfied with marked superiority in one parent only! In a setter
or pointer sensitiveness of nose is the most valuable <i>natural</i> quality
sought for;&mdash;correctness of range the most valuable <i>artificial</i>
quality.</span></p>

<p id="para_371"><span class="small">371. Few horses, however good, are fitted to hunt in all countries,
nor are many dogs; and as in selecting a hunter a man ought to
consider the kind of work for which he is wanted, so ought he
when he is purchasing a dog to be influenced by the kind of country
in which the animal is to perform. A slow dog, however good,
would weary your heart out on the moors with his perpetual see-saw,
ladylike canter; and a fast one, <i>unless wonderfully careful</i>, on
enclosed lands alive with game, would severely test your self-control
over tongue and temper.</span></p>

<p id="para_372"><span class="small">372. If a purchaser be in search of a brace of dogs, assuredly he
ought not to give a large figure for them, if they do not traverse
their ground separately. What is the use of two dogs if they hunt
together? Both are engaged in doing what would be better done
by one, for there would be no undue excitement, or jealousy, or
withdrawal of attention. Not only ought a purchaser to see how
dogs quarter their ground, but, if the time of the year will permit,
he should even kill a bird to them,&mdash;for though they may once have
been good, if an ignorant or careless sportsman has shot over them
but for a few days, they may be spoiled &#40;end of <a href="#para_364">364</a>&#41;.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">DOG SPOILT.</div>

<p id="para_373"><span class="small">373. At the beginning of a partridge season, I unexpectedly
wanted to purchase a dog. An old gamekeeper,&mdash;one on whose
judgment I could rely, and who, I knew, would not willingly deceive
me,&mdash;saw a setter in the field that he thought would please,
and accordingly sent it to my kennel. I greatly liked the looks of
the animal. He quartered his ground well&mdash;was obedient to the
hand&mdash;carried a high and apparently tender nose&mdash;pointed, backed,
and down charged steadily. Unquestionably he had been well
broken. I thought myself in great luck, and should not have
hesitated to complete the purchase, but that fortunately I had an
opportunity of shooting a bird over him, when to my horror, he
rushed at it with the speed of a greyhound. As in spite of all my
remonstrances, shouted in the most determined manner, he repeated
this man&oelig;uvre whenever a bird fell, I returned him. I afterwards
heard he had just been shot over by a party on the moors,
who, no doubt, had spoiled him by their ignoble, pot-hunting propensities.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">HOW REFORMED.</div>

<p id="para_374">374. Had I chosen to sacrifice my shooting in order
to reclaim him &#40;which I must have done, had I too
hastily concluded the purchase&#41;, I ought to have sent
home the other dogs, and proceeded, but with greater
severity, much in the manner described in <a href="#para_321">321</a> and <a href="#para_323">323</a>.
I ought not, however, to have gone after him when
first he bolted; I ought merely to have endeavoured to
check him with my voice, for it would have been most
important to set him a good example by remaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
immoveable myself; he might have misconstrued any
hasty advance on my part into rivalship for possession
of the bird; in short, into a repetition of one of the
many scrambles to which he had recently been accustomed,
and in which I feel sure he must invariably
have come off victorious. I ought, when loaded, to
have walked calmly up to him, and, without taking the
slightest notice of the disfigured bird, have dragged him
back, while loudly rating him, to the spot where he
should have &#8220;down charged.&#8221; After a good flagellation,
a protracted lecture, and a long delay, &#40;the longer the
better,&#41; I ought to have made him cautiously approach
the bird; and by a little scolding, and by showing him
the wounds he had inflicted, have striven to make him
sensible and ashamed of his enormities. Probably, too,
had the birds lain well, the moment he pointed I should
have employed the checkcord<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> with a spike, giving him
a liberal allowance of slack line &#40;<a href="#para_335">335</a>&#41;. Had I thus
treated him throughout the day, I have little doubt but
that he would have become a reformed character; though
an occasional outbreak might not unreasonably have
been expected. &#40;See <a href="#para_302">302</a> to <a href="#para_305">305</a>.&#41;</p>

<p id="para_375"><span class="small">375. If you purchase a dog who has been much shot over single-handed
by a tolerably good sportsman, you have the satisfaction of
knowing that the animal must necessarily have great self-reliance
and experience. On the other hand, you will see reason to distrust
his forbearance and temper when he is hunted with a companion.
Of the usual run of dogs, it probably would be better to purchase
two which have been shot over singly, and then associate them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the field, than to buy a brace which had been broken in together.
You would, I think, find it more difficult to give independence to
the latter, than to cure the jealousy of the former. Jealousy in the
field would, however, decrease with their increasing intimacy in the
kennel.</span></p>

<p>To create a feeling of self-dependence, obviously there
is no better plan than for a considerable time to take
out the dog by himself, and thus force him to trust for
sport to his own unaided powers; and when he is at
length hunted in company, never to omit paying him
the compliment of attending to every indication he
evinces of being upon birds, even occasionally to the
unfair neglect of confirmed points made by the other
dogs.</p>

<p id="para_376"><span class="small">376. Confidence, however, in good breeding and breaking often
induces sportsmen to give large sums for young dogs without seeing
them in the field.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">LARGE SUMS FOR POINTERS.</div>

<p id="para_377"><span class="small">377. In July, 1848, thirteen pointers were sold at Tattersall&#8217;s,
which brought the large sum of two hundred and fifty-six guineas,
though only two of them had ever been shot over.</span></p>

<p id="para_378"><span class="small">378. The following description of each was advertised before the

<div class="pageheader">SMALL SUMS FOR DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_380"><span class="small">380. In marked contrast to such high prices, are those often
realized at Laing&#8217;s and at Wordsworth&#8217;s stables, in Edinburgh,
where sometimes a batch of pointers and setters are sent for unreserved
sale, of whose previous history and education no one can
tell anything, except perhaps, the party sent by the vendor,&mdash;naturally
considered a prejudiced if not an interested witness.</span></p>

<p id="para_381"><span class="small">381. The Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;t</span> named in <a href="#para_289">289</a> boasts, that he never gives
more than half a sovereign for any dog, and that he has some of the
best in Scotland. He attends at Laing&#8217;s and Wordsworth&#8217;s, when
dogs are advertised for sale by auction, and buys all those that are
decent-looking, and fetch no higher bid than ten shillings,&mdash;a frequent
occurrence where their characters are quite unknown. He
takes his bargains to the moors. Those that show any promise he
keeps for further trial; the rest he at once shoots, leaving their
bodies unhonoured by any other burial than the purple heather that
blooms around them.</span></p>

<p id="para_382"><span class="small">382. A red setter brought the largest price that I ever knew paid
for a dog. After mid-day he came upon a covey basking in the
sun. His owner very knowingly told the shooting party that they
might go to luncheon; that he would leave the dog, and accompany
them, engaging that they should find him still steadily pointing on
their return. The promise was faithfully redeemed by the stanch
setter. One of the sportsmen was so struck with the performance,
that he could not resist buying at a tremendous figure, and he soon
regained, I believe, much of the purchase-money from some incredulous
acquaintance, by backing the animal to perform a similar
feat. It was, however, no great test of excellence.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BEST DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_383">383. I conceive those dogs must be considered the
<i>best</i>, which procure a persevering sportsman most shots
in a season, and lose him fewest winged birds.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> If you
are anxious for your pupil to attain this superlative
excellence &#40;I will repeat it, at the risk of being accused
of tautology&#41;, you must be at all times consistently
strict, but never severe. Make him, as much as you
can, your constant companion; you will thereby much
develop his intelligence, and so render him a more
efficient assistant in the field, for he will understand
your manner better and better, and greatly increase in
affection as well as observation. Many men would like
so faithful an attendant. <i>Teach</i> obedience at home&mdash;to
<i>obtain</i> it in the field. Consider the instantaneous &#8220;drop,&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the moment he gets the signal, as all-important,&mdash;as the
very key-stone of the arch that conducts to the glorious
triumphs of due subordination. Notice every fault, and
check it by rating, but never punish with the whip unless
you judge it absolutely necessary. On the other
hand, following Astley&#8217;s plan &#40;<a href="#para_10">10</a>&#41;, reward, or at least
praise, every instance of good behaviour, and you will
be surprised to find how quickly your young dog will
comprehend your wishes, and how anxious he will be to
comply with them. Remember that evil practices, unchecked
until they become confirmed habits, or any
errors in training committed at the commencement of
his education, cannot be repaired afterwards without
tenfold&mdash;nay, twentyfold trouble. Never let him hunt
from under your eye. Unceasingly endeavour to keep
alive in him as long as possible his belief that you are intuitively
aware, as fully when he is out of sight as within
sight, of every fault he commits, whether it arise from
wilfulness or mere heedlessness. This is a very important
admonition. Remember, however, that the best
dogs will occasionally make mistakes when they are
running down wind &#40;especially if it blows hard&#41;, and
that there are days when there is scarcely any scent.
&#40;Note to <a href="#para_174">174</a>.&#41;</p>

<p id="para_384"><span class="small">384. I said, &#8220;Make him,&#8221; &#40;your pupil,&#41; &#8220;as much as you can,
your constant companion.&#8221; Many breakers seem not to consider, or,
at least, seem not to be sufficiently influenced by the consideration,
that it is companionship with us, <i>through successive generations</i>,
which alone has led to the dog&#8217;s becoming the useful servant we find
him. In his wild state he may have as much sagacity as when
domesticated; but this he displays in a manner in no way advantageous
to us;&mdash;it is shown in the mode in which he procures his
food, avoids his enemies, &amp;c. We hear much of the different degrees
of &#8220;natural sagacity&#8221; evinced in different breeds;&mdash;of the
wonderful intelligence of collies, &amp;c.: but surely it is chiefly association
with man that awakened that apparently greater intelligence;
or, to speak more correctly, that gave them the greater habit of
observation,&mdash;of watching their master&#8217;s looks,&mdash;of listening to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
voice, &amp;c.: whence comes their readier comprehension of his wishes
and orders&mdash;often termed sagacity.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BLIND MAN AND TWEED SPANIEL.</div>

<p id="para_385"><span class="small">385. When recently salmon-fishing on the upper part of the
Tweed, I occasionally met on its banks a totally blind man, and
who, in spite of this great disqualification, continued a keen and
successful trout-angler. He had been for some years entirely sightless,
and was led about by a large brown Tweed-side spaniel, of
whose intelligence wonderful stories are told. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;r</span> travelled
much round the country; and it is certain, for he would frequently
do so to show off the dog&#8217;s obedience, that on his saying &#40;the cord
being perfectly slack&#41;, &#8220;Hie off to the Holmes,&#8221; or, &#8220;Hie off to
Melrose,&#8221; &amp;c., &amp;c., the animal would start off in the right direction
without an instant&#8217;s hesitation. Now, this Tweed spaniel was not
born with more brains than other Tweed spaniels, but he was
<span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;r&#8217;s</span> <i>constant</i> companion, and had, in consequence, acquired a
singular facility of comprehending his orders, and doubtless from
great affection was very solicitous to please.</span></p>

<p id="para_386">386. Attend most carefully to the injunction not to
let your dog hunt out of sight. It is essential that you
do so.</p>

<p><span class="small">I once possessed a pointer who behaved admirably while he was
under my eye, but who, if he could cunningly contrive to get on the
other side of rising ground, would invariably, instead of pointing,
make a rush at any game he came across,&mdash;determined, as my Irish
companion used to say, &#8220;to take his divarsion:&#8221; and it was most
curious to remark how immediately his pace would slacken, and
how promptly he would resume a cautious carriage, the moment he
perceived I again had the power of observing him. His proceedings
displayed so much sagacity, that though I was extremely vexed, I
could hardly find it in my heart to punish him as he deserved.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">KILLING SHEEP.</div>

<p id="para_387">387. Notwithstanding Beckford&#8217;s capital story of the
hounds making a dinner of the old ram which his lordship
had left in their kennel to intimidate them, if your
dog be unhappily too fond of mutton or lamb of his own
killing, perhaps no better cure can be <i>attempted</i>, provided
you superintend the operation, than that of muzzling
him, and letting a strong ram give him a butting at the
time that you are administering the lash, and hallooing
out &#8220;Ware&#8221; or &#8220;Sheep.&#8221; But, unfortunately, this too
often fails.</p>

<p id="para_388">388. If you do not succeed, you must hang or drown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
him, &#40;the latter is probably the less painful death, but a
charge of shot well lodged behind the ear in the direction
of the brain would be yet better.&#41; Therefore you
will not mind giving him another chance for his life,
though confessedly the measure proposed is most barbarous.
Procure an ash-pole about five feet long. Tie
one extremity of the pole to a strong ram, by the part
of the horns near the forehead. To the opposite extremity
of the pole attach a strong spiked collar, and strap
it round the dog&#8217;s throat, to the audible tune of &#8220;Ware&#8221;
or &#8220;Sheep.&#8221; &#40;To prevent the possibility of the cord
slipping, through each end of the pole burn a hole.&#41;
The continued efforts of the ram for some hours either
to free himself from his strange companion, or to attack
him, will possibly so worry and punish the dog as to
give him a distaste ever afterwards for anything of a
woolly nature. The pole will so effectually separate
these unwilling &#40;but still too intimate&#41; associates, that
you need not muzzle the dog.</p>

<div class="pageheader">CURE ATTEMPTED.</div>

<p id="para_389">389. There is yet another remedy, which I will name
as it sounds reasonable, though I cannot speak of its
merits from personal observation, never having seen it
tried.</p>

<p>Wrap a narrow strip of sheep-skin, that has much
wool on it, round the dog&#8217;s lower jaw, the wool outwards,
and fasten it so that he cannot get rid of it. Put this
on him for a few hours daily, and there is a chance that
he will become as thoroughly disgusted, as even you
could wish, with every animal of the race whose coat
furnished such odious mouthfuls; but prevention being
better than cure, pay great attention to your dog&#8217;s morals
during the lambing season. Dogs not led away by evil
companionship rarely commence their depredations
upon sober, full-grown sheep. In ninety-nine cases out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of a hundred,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> they have previously yielded to the great
temptation of running down some frisking lamb, whose
animated gambols seemed to court pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="pageheader">THE ADMIRAL&#8217;S PLAN.</div>

<p id="para_390"><span class="small">390. A full admiral &#40;Sir <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;n</span> <span class="glue">S&mdash;&mdash;d</span>&#41;, as well known in the
field as in the ballroom, and whose exhilarating society is coveted
alike by young and old, had many years ago a valuable retriever
named &#8220;Lion,&#8221; bred between a setter and a Newfoundland, fast and
high-couraged, but which had not been properly trained.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">His condemnation had been pronounced by his owner, the late
Sir <span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;n</span> <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;y</span>, in the hearing of the admiral, who at
once asked for and obtained the dog. Sir <span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;s&#8217;</span> keeper &#40;<span class="glue">P&mdash;&mdash;n</span>&#41;
had put a ring upon one of the animal&#8217;s fore-feet to prevent his
travelling too fast. This the admiral immediately removed, and by
making &#8220;Lion&#8221; his companion, and feeding him himself, he soon
brought him into tolerable obedience, but he had the vexation of
finding that the retriever always showed a great longing to chase
sheep, and more than once had pulled one down in spite of all
threats and admonitions.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">One fine summer&#8217;s morning the cheery admiral, who is an excellent
piscator, had started at sunrise across the moors to fish a distant
loch. &#8220;Lion&#8221; quietly followed behind the dog-cart, but on
getting sight of some sheep he started off and overturned one.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">The admiral hurried up in time to save its life. Although alone,
he managed to tie its legs securely together. Ditto &#8220;Lion&#8217;s,&#8221; and
then he laid the two helpless animals nearly side by side. With
his driving-whip he belaboured &#8220;Lion&#8221; most severely, endeavouring

of the flagellation caressing the poor sheep.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">This occurred about 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and the admiral did not return to his

he never did. He turned out an admirable retriever, and a

<p id="para_393"><span class="small">393. We have now arrived at a good halting-station, far beyond
the half-way house; for any dog educated as I have described may
fairly be considered well broken. Shall we here part company, or
will you proceed with me to what I termed &#8220;refinements&#8221; in
breaking? I did so, as I mentioned at the time, in deference to
general opinion, for many would call it superfluous breaking. It
may be&mdash;but the additional excellence is easily attainable by perseverance
in the system which I have detailed, and but little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
extension of it. Why then should we not strive to reach it? It
must, however, be granted that so finished an education is not
absolutely necessary, for many killing dogs never attain it: indeed,
many good sportsmen have never witnessed it. And this is probably
the reason why such a number abjure the aid of a dog in
snipe-shooting.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">REFINEMENTS.&mdash;SNIPE SHOT.</div>

<p id="para_394"><span class="small">394. Years ago, when I was in County Wexford, I knew, by
sight, a capital snipe-shot, though he constantly wore spectacles,
who loathed the idea of letting a dog accompany him. This he
would not have done, had he known to what perfection the animal
could be brought. But certainly our spectacled friend had less
occasion for canine assistance than any man I ever saw. He knew
every rushy spot for miles around. If there was a snipe in a field,
he would point to within a few feet where it was lying. He walked
very fast; was indefatigable; without waiting for loading picked
up every bird the moment it was knocked over; kept relays of
ammunition at several farm-houses; and nearly always came home
with his capacious pockets &#40;for he carried no bag&#41; well filled. I
heard an anecdote of him, more in praise of the correctness of his
eye than the make of his leg, that on one occasion, after he had
stuffed his pockets full of snipe, he proceeded actually to cram more
birds into the tops of his boots.</span></p>

<p id="para_395"><span class="small">395. An officer whom I knew well in Canada came for a few days
to Isle Aux Noix. He paddled himself and a favourite dog to the
opposite shore. The dog made nineteen separate points at snipe&mdash;of
which my friend bagged seventeen,&mdash;and he thinks he did not
see above three more birds. He admits that the day was hot,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and
that in consequence the snipe lay well; but he certainly would not
have obtained so many shots without the assistance of his intelligent
companion. He was, however, beautifully broken. I do not
suppose that my friend had once occasion to use his voice. And
the sagacious animal would creep across wind as stealthily as a
cat on the right hand being slightly raised, as described in <span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_XII">xii</a>.</span>
of 141.</span></p>

<p id="para_396"><span class="small">396. My friend&#8217;s sport caused a laugh in the little garrison at
the expense of its Fort Adjutant, by no means a first-rate shot,
who complained that his favourite, though confessedly very small,
preserve was destroyed for the season; and I rather think it was;
for my experience leads me to believe, contrary to what is generally
supposed, that snipe, when once they have had time to settle in a
spot, become attached to it, and do not much shift their ground.
At least I have known many places in which snipe having been
killed off early in the season, none appeared the same season in
their stead, although in preceding years birds had been plentiful
during the whole winter.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">WOODCOCK-SHOOTING.</div>

<p id="para_397"><span class="small">397. Woodcocks also consider themselves permanently established
in localities where they have been long undisturbed &#40;<a href="#para_82">82</a>&#41;. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
<span class="glue">S&mdash;&mdash;t</span> of <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, on the west coast of Ireland, was so fully impressed
with this opinion that he would not allow a gun to be fired
in his covers until after Christmas,&mdash;asserting that not a bird would
then leave them before the regular period of migration, but merely,
when flushed, remove from one part of the woods to another. It
is hard to think that he reasoned incorrectly, for he had when I
was in his neighbourhood,&mdash;and may have to this day for aught I
know to the contrary,&mdash;nearly the best, if not undeniably the best,
woodcock-shooting in Ireland until the very end of the season.
This, too, is saying a &#8220;big word,&#8221; for woodcock-shooting in the
emerald isle is the cream of sport.</span></p>

<p id="para_398"><span class="small">398. Now our spectacled acquaintance &#40;<a href="#para_394">394</a>&#41;, capital sportsman
as he was, owed his numerous shots solely to his great pedestrian
powers, and the large development of his organ of locality. It is
sometimes difficult enough, even with a clever dog, to spring a jack
snipe, and you will not tell me that he &#40;not master &#8220;Jack,&#8221; but the
gentleman&#41; would not have bagged more birds, and have had to
walk over less ground, had he possessed as good an animal as that
which helped to destroy the Fort Adjutant&#8217;s preserve. And do
you think that our friend with the barnacles, who was in no way of
a misanthropical disposition, would not thus have more enjoyed his
day&#8217;s sport? He might have been assured that birds, if they would
not lie for a good-nosed dog, who hunted as cautiously as the
officer&#8217;s, would not lie for his walking them up. And if on a
boisterous day he chose to shoot down wind &#40;as snipe fly against it&#41;,
why should he not call his companion in to &#8220;heel,&#8221; and afterwards
employ him when re-hunting the same ground up wind? An <i>experienced</i>
old dog, would rarely, however, when beating down wind,
pass by many birds without noticing them.</span></p>

<p id="para_399"><span class="small">399. We often hear of sportsmen shooting against each other for
considerable sums in our best partridge-counties, where the game is
so abundant that they consider it most advisable to employ no dog,
save one or two retrievers. I at once admit that they act judiciously
in not hunting any ordinary animal, but I am confident that the
competitor who used such a cautious dog as the officer&#8217;s &#40;<a href="#para_395">395</a>&#41;, would
not only get more shots than his opponent, but be able to kill to
a greater certainty, because better prepared for every rise. The
quantity of game would not have confused that first-rate dog,&mdash;his
nose was too discriminating. He would have walked quietly,&mdash;almost
crept,&mdash;up to every bird, and I will venture to say would
not have sprung one out of shot, that would not have risen as
readily had he been left in his kennel. In the match that came off
in October, &#8217;50, at Lord <span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;h&#8217;s</span>, <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;d</span> Hall, between the Squire
<span class="glue">O&mdash;&mdash;n</span> and Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;d</span>,&mdash;both good performers&mdash;so many birds
would not have been missed had the sportsmen been warned to look
out for most of their shots by a careful dog&#8217;s drawing upon the
birds. Victory would have sided with the party thus aided.</span></p>

<p id="para_400"><span class="small">400. I said &#40;<a href="#para_398">398</a>&#41;, &#8220;An experienced old dog would rarely, however,
even when beating down wind, pass by many birds without
noticing them:&#8221; and most fortunate is it that this is the case, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
otherwise you would seldom get a shot to a point at partridge when
the ground is wet, and the birds have taken to running ahead along
furrow&mdash;or, as is frequently the case, are all making off in one
direction, probably seeking the shelter of some well-known friendly
cover. Should you think this likely to happen, you must, without
minding what quarter the wind blows from, commence your beat
by traversing the ground that lies between them and their place of
refuge. Even then you will often find that they will rather face
you, than be diverted from their original design.</span></p>

<p id="para_401"><span class="small">401. In large turnip-fields you would do well when birds are
wild to hunt the outer parts first, and so gradually work round and
round towards the centre. Then return to the outer parts, and
again work round the borders. The birds thus finding themselves
headed in every direction are much more likely to lie than if you
had not so man&oelig;uvred. On such occasions the great advantages of
caution in dogs, and of their prompt obedience to the hand are made
manifest. I heard of a man who, in order to make birds lie close
in turnips, used to direct his little boy to trot his pony round and
round the field. The plan was very successful. The birds seemed
quite bewildered, especially when time had been allowed for the
boy to complete the circuit before the dogs were permitted to enter.
I remember a good sportsman telling me that he had more than
once succeeded in making wild birds lie by attaching soft-sounding
bells to the collars of his pointers. The novel sound appeared to
arrest the attention of the partridges. This seems opposed to
what is said in <a href="#para_74">74</a> about bells used in cover scaring game.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">DRIEST GROUND HUNTED.</div>

<p id="para_402"><span class="small">402. High winds and rain greatly disturb birds; and if you are
a tyro in partridge-shooting you should thank me for recommending
you, if you are ever so anxious to get a few shots, to wait for the
first hour of sunshine after such weather,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and then to hunt the
<i>driest</i> grounds, where you probably will find the birds <i>not feeding</i>,
but quietly reposing, after the knocking about they have undergone.
But, my <i>young</i> friend, I should like to give you another hint.
When it is late in the season, instead of constantly beating the
denuded stubbles, try the wild uncultivated lands &#40;if there are any
in your neighbourhood&#41; where it is likely the birds will be found
searching for the common grass-seeds which they neglected when
more palatable grain could be easily obtained. Wind without wet
sometimes makes wild birds lie,&mdash;probably because they do not hear
the sportsman&#8217;s footsteps.</span></p>

<p id="para_403">403. After you have sprung a covey, and succeeded in killing the
old pair, should the scent be bad, give the young birds time to run
a little before you let your dogs hunt for them. Late in the season,
in hot, dry weather, such delay is frequently productive of much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
good, for partridges will often at such times not move an inch from
the spot where they first pitched; thereby emitting so little scent
that an ordinary dog will not be able to find them, however accurately
you may have marked the place where they <i>opened their wings</i> preparatory
to dropping.</p>

<div class="pageheader">KILL OLD BIRDS.</div>

<p id="para_404"><span class="small">404. If, when first a covey rose, the old pair was knocked over,
the young ones would lie singularly close, awaiting the accustomed,
unspellable, unpronounceable parental call. But there is a yet
stronger reason why the precedence and attention usually given to
age should not in the present instance be withheld. <i>Old birds,
whether breeding or barren, drive off the younger ones during the
breeding season.</i> Some sportsmen, I am aware, deem this opinion
a vulgar prejudice; but, if it be well founded, common sense bids
us kill the old birds, that the young ones may have undisturbed
possession of their ground. They must be unusually small squeakers
if they cannot shift for themselves early in September, particularly
if the weather be warm. They will come to no harm, where the
keeper has done his duty as a trapper. On estates infested with
vermin, they will, of course, suffer from the absence of the warning
parental cry. There are country gentlemen who go so far as to
have the old birds shot in August &#40;when they can readily be distinguished
even in the most forward coveys&#41;, well knowing that a
jealous old pair of partridges will take possession of as much ground
in spring, as would suffice for nearly half-a-dozen young couples;
especially if the latter belong to the same covey, and are therefore
accustomed to associate together; for, contrary to the general laws
of nature, these birds breed in and in.</span></p>

<p id="para_405"><span class="small">405. Old hen-pheasants should also be killed off:&mdash;they are barren,
and are accused of sucking the eggs of the younger birds. They
may be readily distinguished by their deeper and more brilliant
plumage. As a case in point,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">YORKSHIRE GAMEKEEPER&#8217;S ADVICE.</div>

<p id="para_406"><span class="small">406. I know of a gentleman going to the North to reside on a
small property, where the game had not been preserved for years.
He at once engaged a clever keeper, who joined him immediately
after the conclusion of the shooting season. In a few days the
latter requested to see his master.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;Well, George, I fear you don&#8217;t find much game.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span class="small">The other replied, in broad Yorkshire dialect, &#8220;No-o, sir, no&mdash;n&#335;t

<p><span class="small">The gentleman started. &#8220;Shoot them! That&#8217;s an odd way of

<p id="para_407"><span class="small">407. This homely reasoning of the honest Yorkshireman<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> prevailed,
and a good show of game the following season satisfactorily
established the soundness of his views.</span></p>

<p id="para_408"><span class="small">408. But we have been astray on the stubbles and in cover, instead
of attending to our friend &#40;<a href="#para_394">394</a>, <a href="#para_398">398</a>&#41; snipe-shooting in the
marshes, and determining &#40;for our own satisfaction, if not for his&#41;
whether the companionship of a good dog would not have greatly
added to his enjoyment. Doubtless it would; for I appeal to you,
if you are a devotee to the double detonator, whether it be not a
magnificent thing to witness brilliant performance in fine dogs&mdash;to
watch their prompt obedience&mdash;their graceful action&mdash;the expression
of their intelligent countenances&mdash;to hope at the first feathering
at a haunt&mdash;to participate in the nervous start on a closer touch&mdash;to
share in the exciting alternation of the cautious &#8220;road,&#8221; and
the momentary stop&mdash;to exult in the certainty of a sure find&mdash;to
hesitate in the expectation of a sudden rise,&mdash;and, finally, to triumph
in the fall of the noble old bird you have been steadily following
through all his wiles and stratagems? If we have travelled over
the past pages together, I hope you will further agree with me in
thinking, that should you shoot over well-educated dogs of your
<i>own making</i>, instead of to dogs broken by others, your gratification
would be as greatly increased as would have been our Irish acquaintance&#8217;s,
had he shot to really killing dogs, instead of possessing none
at all. I firmly believe that more than half the pleasure a sportsman
derives from shooting, consists in watching the hunting of well broken
dogs, and that his gratification is nearly doubled if the dogs
are of his own training. It was this persuasion that, on our introduction
to each other &#40;<a href="#para_3">3</a>&#41;, made me so strongly urge you to break
in your dogs yourself.</span></p>

<p id="para_409"><span class="small">409. I might urge you to do so from yet another motive. What
can you name besides glorious hunting that will keep you in strength
and prime condition so long as shooting? Is not an autumnal excursion
to the wild moors, or even homely stubbles, far more invigorating
than a saunter at the most salubrious watering-place?
And would not continued, though it may be diminished, zest for
the sport induce you to take air and exercise at a time of life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
when little else would lure you from the fire-side? That shooting,
then, may not pall upon you as years creep on, surely you would
do well to make the healthy recreation as attractive as possible; and
hunting dogs of your own breaking would undeniably lend it not
only a great but an enduring charm.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">OLD SCOTCH SPORTSMAN.</div>

<p id="para_410"><span class="small">410. A fondness for the beauties of nature, a sense of freedom
while one is inhaling the pure mountain breezes, and it may be a
consciousness of power, have made men bordering on four-score
continue to love their guns with a feeling somewhat akin to the
fervour of their first love, as is well exemplified in an aged tenant
of Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;n</span> of Edinburgh, to whom I have been occasionally
indebted for a capital day&#8217;s sport.</span></p>

<p id="para_411"><span class="small">411. Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;n</span> visiting one of his farms, found the old man,
who had been a keen sportsman all his life, labouring under chronic
rheumatism &#40;caught by injudicious exposure in the discharge of his
agricultural duties&#41;, so severe as to be obliged to go about on
crutches. After the usual salutations, at meeting, the farmer
began:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;May be ye&#8217;ll think the place negleckit-like, but I&#8217;m no able to
look after the wark noo.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;Keep a good heart,&#8221; said Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;n</span>; &#8220;things are looking
well enough. I suppose you are pining after the shooting&mdash;you
can get no sport now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;Ye may weel think that,&#8221; replied the farmer, adding in a sort
of chuckle and confidential undertone, &#8220;the auld gun and me is
no parted yet.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;But,&#8221; rejoined Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, &#8220;you surely don&#8217;t mean that you
can still kill birds? You can hardly manage that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;I can manage it fine,&#8221; observed the other, with some pique;
&#8220;the cart takes me to the neeps.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The bit callant<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> helps me oot.

laddie takes haud o&#8217; me, and though my legs is neither straught
nor steady, my e&#8217;e is as true as yer ain.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_412"><span class="small">412. Breaking in dogs is not only an invigorating bodily exercise,
but a healthy moral training; for to obtain <i>great</i> success, you must
have much patience and self-command; and whatever may be your
rank or position in life, Beckford&mdash;not he of Fonthill, but the man
whose memory is held in veneration by all Nimrods for his admirable
&#8220;Thoughts on Hunting&#8221;&mdash;will not allow you to plead, as an
excuse, for what just possibly may be want of energy or sad
laziness, that breaking in dogs for your own gun is an ungentlemanly
or unbecoming recreation. I grant he is speaking of instructors
of hounds, but his words in their spirit are fully as applicable to
the instructors of pupils accustomed to the smell of gunpowder.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BECKFORD CITED.</div>

<p id="para_413"><span class="small">413. In his 22d letter he writes, &#8220;It is your opinion, I find, that
a gentleman might make the best huntsman. I have no doubt that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
he would, if he chose the trouble of it. I do not think there is any
profession, trade, or occupation, in which a good education would
not be of service; and hunting, notwithstanding that it is at present
exercised by such as have not had an education, might without
doubt be carried on much better by those that have. I will venture
to say fewer faults would be committed, nor is it probable the same
faults would be committed over and over again as they now are.
Huntsmen never reason by analogy, nor are they much benefited by
experience.&#8221; I fear we may say the same of the generality of
keepers, for decidedly dog-breaking has not kept pace with the
manifest improvements in other arts. Few brigades&mdash;indeed few
dogs are now-a-days broken like Major <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;d&#8217;s</span> &#40;<a href="#para_251">251</a>&#41;, or Captain
<span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;n&#8217;s</span> &#40;<a href="#para_542">542</a>&#41;. But I do not intend to say it is necessary; all
that is merely for show might be advantageously dispensed with.</span></p>

<p id="para_414"><span class="small">414. It is hard to imagine what it would be impossible to teach
a dog, did the attainment of the required accomplishment sufficiently
recompense the instructor&#8217;s trouble. Most of us have heard
of the celebrated dog &#8220;Munito,&#8221; who, at some private signal from
his master, quite imperceptible to the spectator, would select from
a pack of outspread cards that which the spectator had named to
the master in a whisper, or merely written on a piece of paper.</span></p>

<p id="para_415"><span class="small">415. In the unenclosed parts of France, when the young crops
are on the ground, you may frequently see a shepherd&#8217;s dog trusted
to prevent the sheep from nibbling the tender wheat growing contiguous
to the grass, which he peaceably permits them to crop within
a foot of the tempting grain; but he is keenly watching, ready to
dart at the first epicure who cannot resist a bite at the forbidden
dainty; and so ably and zealously does the dog discharge his duties,
that even in such trying circumstances will the shepherd leave his
sheep for hours together under the charge of their sagacious and
vigilant guardian. In a similar manner, a couple of dogs, stationed
one at each flank of a large flock, effectually protect the vineyards
from their depredations. The latter you will think not so remarkable
an instance of discrimination as the former; for, compared
with the difference in appearance between the herbage and the vine,
there is but little between the young grain and the adjacent grass.</span></p>

<p id="para_416"><span class="small">416. Who has not read with intense delight the tales of the
almost incredible intelligence and devotion to their duties of the
Scotch collie dogs, as related by the Ettrick Shepherd? He
mentions one which, when his master was speaking, evidently
understood much of what was said.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">FAIRY AND M&Eacute;DOR.</div>

<p id="para_417"><span class="small">417. I know a lady who had a small, nearly thorough-bred King
Charles. Being one day desired by her mother to ring the bell,
she turned to the dog, and said, very energetically, &#8220;Fairy, ring the
bell.&#8221; The little dog had no previous training, but she had been
observant, and was imitative. She immediately sprung at the bell rope,
and pulled it. &#8220;Fairy,&#8221; indeed, unfortunately pulled with
great violence&mdash;the rope came down, and so alarmed was she &#40;remember
how I have cautioned you never to alarm your pupil&#41;, that
no subsequent coaxing could induce her to return to the bell. But
if she had not been frightened, she might have become as serviceable
a bell-ringer as the little dog that preceded her in the office of
pet. That predecessor &#40;the mention of a <i>useful pet</i>, though a lady
was not his instructor, will, I hope, redeem my character with the
fair sex&#41; saved his young mistress from many an interruption of
work and study, by ringing the bell on command. And &#8220;Bob&#8221;
was discreet in his <i>spontaneous</i> ringings. He never rang without a
cause; but if he was unreasonably detained by himself, or a visitor&#8217;s
knock remained too long unanswered, the tardy attendant was
warned of his remissness by a loud peal.</span></p>

<p id="para_418"><span class="small">418. A French lady, who is fond of animals, at my request committed
the following anecdote to paper:&mdash;</span></p>

<p id="para_419"><span class="small">419. &#8220;My dear M&eacute;dor, a beautiful red and white setter, was remarkable,
I am told, for many rare qualities as a sporting dog;
but, of course, none of these could be compared, in <i>my</i> eyes, to his
faithfulness and sagacity. I looked upon him as a friend; and
I know that our affection was mutual. I could mention several
instances of his intelligence, I might say reflection, but one in particular
gave me such delight that, though years have since passed
away, all the circumstances are as fresh in my memory as if they
had occurred but yesterday. I was returning from school at Versailles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and having rung uselessly for a little time at the front door,
I went round to the carriage-gate to have a chat with my silky-haired
favourite. He barked anxiously; thrust his cold nose through
an opening near the ground; scratched vigorously to increase its
size; and in numerous ways testified great joy at again hearing my
voice. I put my hand under the gate to caress him, and while he
was licking it, I said in jest, but in a distinct, loud voice, &#8216;Dear
M&eacute;dor, I am shut out&mdash;go, bring me the keys.&#8217; It so happened that
the stable where they usually hung was not closed. M&eacute;dor ran off,
and in a few seconds returned and placed them in my hands. I
will not attempt to describe <i>my</i> gratification at such a striking proof
of his intelligence, nor <i>his</i> evident pride at seeing me enter the hall;
nor yet the fright of the servant at thinking how long the street-door
must have been carelessly left open. &#8216;M&eacute;dor deserves that
his life should be written,&#8217; said I to my uncle when afterwards
telling him the whole story; &#8216;I am sure his deeds are as wonderful
as those related of the &#8220;Chiens c&eacute;l&egrave;bres&#8221; by De Fr&eacute;ville.&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;My setter was immediately declared &#8216;Keeper of the Keys,&#8217; and
forthwith invested with all the rights of office,&mdash;nor was this confidence
misplaced. He would never give up his charge to any one
but to my uncle or myself; and always seemed fully sensible of the
dignity and responsibility of his new position.&#8221;</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SULTAN AND THE GATE-KEY.</div>

<p id="para_420"><span class="small">420. Another anecdote touching keys.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">A family residing at Chepstow had a house with a gate leading
into the castle-ditch, and they used to pass through it almost daily
in order to avoid the bustle of the town. The key of this gate was
kept in the kitchen, and a black retriever, Sultan by name, was
accustomed to ask the cook for it by pulling her dress until he succeeded
in bringing her under the nail on which the key was hung,
and he always returned it most honestly when the family had done
with it. One day, however, having brought it back as usual, he
found the cook too busy to attend to him, and, growing impatient
he trotted off with it, and for a whole fortnight it was missing. At
length Miss <span class="glue">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, being much inconvenienced by its loss, armed
herself with a whip, and, standing by the gate, called the dog, and
said in a very determined tone, &#8220;Now, Sultan, bring me that <i>key
directly</i>.&#8221; Off he went to a gooseberry-bush, scratched up the key,
and brought it to her. He had, probably, found the same spot a
safe depository for many a bone.</span></p>

<p id="para_421"><span class="small">421. Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, with whom I was slightly acquainted,&mdash;a man
of great originality, and singular shrewdness and intelligence,&mdash;had
a dog called Taffy, who had a remarkable aptitude for comprehending
whatever was told him. He knew by name every member of Mr.
<span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n&#8217;s</span> family, though composed at least of ten individuals. On
his master&#8217;s saying, &#8220;Taffy, give so-and-so a grip,&#8221; the dog would to
a certainty take hold of the right person. &#8220;Harder, Taffy,&mdash;give a
harder grip;&#8221; the dog would bite more firmly. At the third order,
&#8220;Harder, my boy,&mdash;yet harder,&#8221; the party assaulted would be too
glad to <i>sue</i> for mercy; for no one dared to <i>strike</i> Taffy excepting
Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span>. Even to him the animal never submitted quietly, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
kept growling and snarling whenever he was being punished&mdash;indeed,
on more than one occasion he fought for the mastery, but unsuccessfully,
for few men are more resolute than was Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span>.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">TAFFY A GOOD WATCH-DOG.</div>

<p id="para_422"><span class="small">422. Taffy was an admirable watch-dog, and fully sensible of the
responsible duties that devolved upon him. It happened that, in
a violent storm, late one evening, when Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span> was from
home, the force of the wind drove in the front door. Taffy forthwith
commenced a search from the bottom of the house to the
top, apparently to ascertain that no stranger had entered, and he
then went downstairs. Next morning he was found lying across
the door-mat, where evidently he had remained the whole night,
although the cold and wet had been most severe.</span></p>

<p id="para_423"><span class="small">423. Taffy&#8217;s character was so established as a sagacious, faithful
guardian, that Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n&#8217;s</span> sister-in-law, feeling nervous at her
husband&#8217;s being obliged to leave home, begged the loan of Taffy
for a few nights. Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span> consented, and ordered Taffy,
manifestly to his great annoyance, to remain at the house. Four
days afterwards he reappeared at home, when Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, in the
belief that he had run away, was about to beat him, but was
persuaded to suspend the punishment until it was ascertained
whether Mrs. <span class="glue">&mdash;&mdash;</span> had not brought him into the neighbourhood.
About an hour afterwards she arrived to make inquiries about the
dog, who, she said, had left her house the moment her husband put
his foot withinside the door.</span></p>

<p id="para_424"><span class="small">424. Taffy was also a sporting character,&mdash;I fear I ought to say a
<i>poaching</i> character,&mdash;for he was a peculiar dog, he had peculiar
ideas&mdash;would that such ideas were more <i>peculiar</i>&mdash;on the subject of
game, and fancied all means lawful that insured success. In the
Isle of Wight there once were &#40;probably the spot is now drained&#41;
ten or twelve acres of marsh-land, nearly surrounded by water,
much in the shape of a horse-shoe. It was a favourite resort for
hares, as Taffy well knew. His bulk prevented his ever having a
chance of catching any in a fair run; he used, therefore, to dodge
about between them and the outlet, and would so worry and distress
them, that he was pretty certain of eventually carrying off one as a
prize.</span></p>

<p id="para_425"><span class="small">425. We all remember the story of the unfortunate tailor deluged
with a shower of dirty water by the indignant elephant whose proboscis
he had imprudently insulted in the morning by pricking it
with his needle, instead of presenting the expected delicacy. It
would appear as though Taffy had heard and understood the anecdote.
He was once pelted with stones by some boys from behind a wall:
having then no means of retaliating, he seemed to take the affront
quietly, but he did not forget it; he patiently bided his time, and,
as opportunities offered, avenged himself upon each successively by
knocking them down in the dirt; nor did he allow one to escape
unpunished, though some of them avoided him for three weeks or a
month. There were six offenders, and he made all the six expiate
their offences in a dirty kennel.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">TAFFY PURLOINS.</div>

<p id="para_426"><span class="small">426. Indeed, Taffy would <i>never</i> allow anybody, young or old, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
play tricks upon him with impunity. On one occasion, when the
labourers had left off work to take their dinners, one of them
amused himself by offering Taffy a piece of bread stuck on the end
of a knife, and by suddenly turning it over, managed to give the
dog a rap on the nose with the handle, on his attempting to seize
the proffered gift. Taffy bore the joke patiently for some time; but
at length, thinking that his good-nature was unduly taxed, and
perceiving also that the loaf was fast decreasing, he determined to
turn the tables. Bristling up, therefore, he jumped, open-mouthed,
at the man, and so alarmed him, that in his fright he dropped the
bread, and Taffy quietly walked off with it, much to the delight of
the bystanders.</span></p>

<p id="para_427"><span class="small">427. Though Taffy&#8217;s natural parts were so great, they were
doubtless improved by education. If Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span> ever called the
dog&#8217;s attention to a thing by pointing at it, the dog would, to
nearly a certainty, bring it to him when he had got well out of
sight, and was, therefore, not likely to be suspected of participating
in the robbery. Many a time has Taffy run off with the <i>finest</i> fish
from the side of the unsuspecting angler, who, until he was enlightened
upon the subject on its safe restoration, may in his bewilderment
have gravely considered whether, under very favouring
circumstances, it would be possible for a trout to possess the same
vitality and power of locomotion as an eel. It always tended to the
maintenance of the piscator&#8217;s proverbial reputation for patience and
equanimity, that he should not detect Taffy in the commission of
the theft; for the dog would constantly show fight rather than give
up the prize. He evinced yet greater adroitness in securing pigeons.
On numerous occasions bets have been laid, and rarely lost, that he
would bring home the <i>particular</i> one indicated to him out of a large
flock feeding on the ground; for he would patiently crouch,&mdash;perhaps
affecting to be asleep,&mdash;until it incautiously afforded him the
opportunity of seizing it; but so careful was he of his charge, that
he invariably delivered it up to his master, perfectly uninjured.</span></p>

<p id="para_428"><span class="small">428. With all his cunning and eccentricities, Taffy was &#8220;passing
honest,&#8221; and seldom purloined on his own account; but I regret to
say it is recorded of him, that in a moment of weakness and hunger
he yielded to temptation. The instance was this.&mdash;Taffy observed
a woman seated at a cottage-door feeding her child. He earnestly
begged for a share, but in vain. Remarking, however, that she
frequently turned round to dip the spoon into something, he contrived
to creep behind her without her perceiving him, when to his
satisfaction he discovered a basin of pap on the floor. It was too
hot to gobble up at once; so waiting quietly until her attention
was drawn away, he cautiously took up the crock and trotted off
with it&mdash;to the good woman&#8217;s dismay, who was wondering what had
become of her dear baby&#8217;s dinner&mdash;and, without spilling any of the
contents, carried it to a convenient distance, where he leisurely ate
up all the carefully-prepared food, leaving the basin perfectly undamaged,
and as clean as if it had been washed by the most praiseworthy
housewife.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<div class="pageheader">TAFFY&#8217;S PARENTAGE.</div>

<p id="para_429"><span class="small">429. Other stories could be told of Taffy&#8217;s sagacity, but these
you will probably think more than sufficient. However, you would
perhaps like to hear how he was bred. No one can tell you more
than that, judging from his appearance, he must have had a strain
of the Newfoundland in him, for the circumstances attending his
birth and parentage are nearly as singular as his character.</span></p>

<p id="para_430"><span class="small">430. A ship was lost in a storm off the Needles, in 1811. Nothing
was saved, not a plank whereon was a letter to indicate to
what country she belonged. For some weeks afterwards, a farmer
in the Isle of Wight found that regularly every night one of his
sheep was destroyed. A watch was set. The culprit was at length
discovered to be a strange, savage-looking dog, supposed to have
escaped from the wreck. For many, many nights it baffled its pursuers,
but was at length wounded, and tracked by its blood to a cave,
where it was killed. Three young pups were found. One of them,
the said Taffy, was saved, and brought up by hand by Mr. <span class="glue">A&mdash;&mdash;n</span>,
who became so fond of it that their attachment might almost be
said to be mutual. Taffy lived admired and honoured beyond the
term of life usually assigned to the canine race.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">JESSE&#8217;S OPINION.</div>

<p id="para_431"><span class="small">431. Jesse<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> narrates many instances similar to the foregoing, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
his amusing work on Dogs&mdash;a book likely to convince the most
sceptical, that few among us give the canine race credit for half the
sagacity and intelligence with which they are really endowed. He
asserts, and I, for one, fully agree with him, &#8220;that there is not a
faculty of the human mind, of which some evident proof of its
existence may not be found in dogs. Thus,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we find
them possessed of memory, imagination, curiosity, cunning, revenge,
ingenuity, gratitude, devotion or affection, and other qualities.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_432"><span class="small">432. To this list he ought to have added jealousy: only this year
I heard of a stronger instance of it than I could have imagined
possible. Walking near Devonport, I met a man with two small
dogs; one was evidently a foreigner. Apologising for the abruptness
of the question, I inquired from what country the animal
came. &#8220;From Japan.&#8221; I then asked whether he had ever bred
from the other dog, a most varmint-looking, wiry little terrier; he
replied that she was three years old, and had never had but one
pup, which, because he was fondling it, she had deliberately killed
that very morning, although it was six weeks old, and she was still
nursing it. I cannot say that she manifested either sorrow for its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
loss, or repentance of her unnatural conduct; on the contrary her
joyous gambols seemed to evince her delight at having removed
from her path a dreaded rival in the affections of her master.</span></p>

<p id="para_433"><span class="small">433. We must all admit that they have much reflection, or they
would not evince the good judgment they so frequently display in
unusual circumstances&mdash;circumstances in which mere instinct could
in no way assist them.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> An industrious couple, who lived high on
the side of one of the romantic Ennerdale Hills, &#40;Cumberland&#41; in
a cottage which had descended through several generations from
father to son, used to gather fuel in a neighbouring wood. They
often took their little daughter with them; but one evening, whilst
hunting for wild flowers, she strayed beyond their sight or hearing.
They searched unceasingly for their lost darling as long as the
waning light permitted them to distinguish objects amidst the thick
foliage; and then, with heavy hearts, turned towards home, the
father endeavouring to cheer the mother with the hope he could
not himself entertain that the little girl might have wandered to her
accustomed haunts; but they had the grief of finding that she had
not returned; and fruitless also was the anxious search renewed by
torchlight. The poor mother mechanically spread out the frugal
supper, thinking it possible that her husband might partake of the
food she could not taste. It would, however, have remained on the
board untouched had not the old dog seized a large slice of the loaf
and rushed out of the cottage. The father quietly observed, &#8220;I
never knew the dog to thieve before.&#8221; Ere the day had fully
dawned, they were again hunting the wood; but they could discover
no trace of their child. At breakfast-time the dog, as on the
preceding evening, purloined a piece of bread. The man was about
to strike the depredator, but his wife, her countenance radiant with
hope, stopped him with the exclamation, &#8220;I am sure he knows
where Agnes is.&#8221; They ran down hill after him, and at length found
him near the edge of the lake, lying on the child to keep her warm.
She appeared quite satisfied with her position, and extremely pleased
with her shaggy companion. In her small fat fingers she grasped
the stolen bread, together with many flowers she had gathered.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">PHILAX AND BRAC.</div>

<p id="para_434"><span class="small">434. You may have seen the account of the marvellous tricks
which Monsieur Leonard, by kindness and perseverance, taught his
dogs Philax and Brac. That a dog could be tutored into playing
as good a game of dominos as a man, may sound preposterously
unreasonable, but the respectability of the writer compels us to give
credence to the recital.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SHOWMAN&#8217;S DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_435"><span class="small">435. I, also, had once the honour of playing a game of dominos
with a learned dog, whose celebrity, however, was far inferior to
that acquired by M. Leonard&#8217;s clever pupil. It thus happened.
As I was crossing the <i>Place St. Sulpice</i>, at Paris, I saw a large
crowd collected in a circle of considerable diameter round a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
who was exhibiting tricks with dogs. He had a great variety. Six
were yoked in pairs to a light carriage. On the roof sat a terrier
dressed up most fantastically, and who with difficulty retained his
elevated position when the carriage was in motion. Two others,&mdash;one
an extremely small animal, called the &#8220;petit Caporal,&#8221;&mdash;were
favoured with places in the interior. There were, also, two slight
greyhounds and a Russian poodle. Total, a dozen. It may be
worthy of note that all, with, I believe, only one exception, were
of the masculine gender. They were miserably thin, but I must
admit that they appeared attached to their master.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_260" id="ill_260"></a>
<img src="images/ill_260.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="380" />
<p class="caption">DOMINI AND &#8216;DOMINOS.&#8217;&mdash;Par. <a href="#para_434">434</a>.</p>
</div>

<p id="para_436"><span class="small">436. When I joined the group, the showman was making a dog,
dressed in a petticoat and smart cap, dance a minuet. Then a
greyhound leaped, of course gracefully, through a hoop held by a
boy over his head; and afterwards trotted, as ungracefully, on three
legs, affecting extreme lameness on each alternately. The man
then promised numerous surprising feats if he could but collect
as many as twelve sous. On summing up the coppers thrown to
him, there appeared to be thirteen. This he averred to be such an
unlucky number that he dare not proceed unless some benevolent,
Christian-like person would break the charm by adding another
sou. His demand was immediately complied with.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">In order to increase the size of the arena&mdash;at least, such I conceived
to be the reason, it certainly had the effect&mdash;he drove the
car fast round the circle. He then spread ten cards on the four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
sides of an old cloth, about five feet long, and of nearly the same
width. Each card bore a legibly-written number from 0 to 9. He
invited the spectators to ask for whatever number they pleased,
provided it did not hold doublets, nor contain more than four of
the cyphers; asserting that his dogs, without the least assistance
from him, would bring, in regular order, the several cards representing
the required number; and to create, as it seemed to me,
the impression that it was a matter of perfect indifference what
dog he took, he unyoked one of the leaders,&mdash;a close-cropped, small
Dane,&mdash;and called him to the centre. I begged a lady who was
leaning on my arm, and whose eyes are generally sharp enough, to
watch the man most carefully. Some one demanded 1824. The
dog went round and round the cloth as if examining every card
separately, and lifted, in regular succession &#40;carrying them one by
one to his master&#41;, the several numbers composing 1824. The dog
committed no blunder; and did not long hesitate in making his
selection. Another person in the crowd called out for 29, when
the dog was equally successful; and on neither occasion could the
lady or myself perceive that the man gave the slightest sign. At one
time I thought I had detected that he took a short step forward, as
if to receive the card, when the dog was about to grasp the right
one; but I was soon aware that I had only found a &#8220;mare&#8217;s nest.&#8221;</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">CARD TRICKS.</div>

<p id="para_437"><span class="small">437. When reharnessing the Dane to the carriage, the showman
gave out that, if duly paid, he could exhibit before the &#8220;respectable
and discriminating company&#8221; the feats of a far more wonderful
animal. He collected what satisfied him; and producing two
similar packs of common playing cards &#40;say a dozen in each&#41;, he
bade the Russian come forth and astonish the public. The man
distributed one pack along the borders of the cloth; and handing
round the other pack, he begged as many of the company as pleased,
to take a card. Five or six did so. The man then showed what
cards remained in his hands to the poodle, desiring him to point
out those that had been taken. The dog walked round and round
the cloth, and one by one fetched the corresponding cards.</span></p>

<p id="para_438"><span class="small">438. The showman still more astonished the gaping crowd by
assuring them that this dog&#8217;s intellect was so extraordinary and
wonderful, that he could read their most secret thoughts; and to
prove the truth of his assertion, whilst telling a good-humoured
fiacre-driver, well known to many of them, to think of a card, he
successfully <i>forced</i><a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> one upon his sight: and after coachee had,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
agreeably to the showman&#8217;s desire, whispered to a neighbour what
it was, the dog, without taking much time for reflection, selected
the true card from among those lying on the cloth.</span></p>

<p id="para_439"><span class="small">439. The expressions of admiration and bewilderment this feat
elicited having somewhat subsided, the showman again laid out
those cards on which the numbers were written. There was a large
public clock easily visible from the <i>Place</i>: he held the dog&#8217;s head
towards it; requested him to look at it attentively, and tell the
gentlemen and ladies the exact time,&mdash;first the hours, then the
minutes. It was a quarter-past two. The dog brought 2 for the
hours, and then 1 and 5 for the minutes.</span></p>

<p id="para_440"><span class="small">440. Having now sufficiently worked upon the imagination and
credulity of the observers, the showman drew forth a quantity of
small folded papers of various colours; and having spread them
along the edges of the cloth, he solemnly protested that the dog
would tell the fortune of any of his hearers who would first give
him a sou. As a guarantee for the dog&#8217;s ability, he told them they
might compare the several fortunes written on the papers selected
for them by the dog, however numerous they might be, when it
would be found that, without a single exception, the canine magician
would have foretold to each what could only happen to an individual
of his or her sex. The charlatan reaped a plentiful harvest, for the
temptation was strong&mdash;to female curiosity especially; and no one
could prove that the dog was ever in error.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">PLAYING DOMINOS.</div>

<p id="para_441"><span class="small">441. After a laughable exhibition of several of the dogs marching
in procession, which he called &#8220;the carnival of Venice,&#8221; he affected
suddenly to discover that none of the dogs had been allowed a
game of dominos. He again unyoked the Dane, and asked if any
one was willing to become his antagonist. As no one would step
forward, whether from bashfulness or fear of necromancy I cannot
say, I avowed my willingness to play. There were fourteen dominos.
I drew seven. The others were arranged for the dog on the cloth,
far apart from one another. He had the double six, and he immediately
took it up to begin the game. I followed; and we alternately
played a piece in the most orderly and regular manner&mdash;the
dog carrying the dominos to the man to place for him; wagging his
short stump when he found &#40;from his master&#8217;s manner&#41;, that he
was right; and, to do him justice, he never made a mistake.</span></p>

<p id="para_442"><span class="small">442. Although I was now close to the showman, I could not remark
that he gave the least signal by look, or by motion of hand or
foot: but I fancied&mdash;this, however, may be only another &#8220;mare&#8217;s
nest,&#8221; though I cannot think it was&mdash;that I heard him make a slight
chuckling sound<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> &#40;with his tongue against the roof of his mouth&#41;,
whilst the dog was walking round from domino to domino, which
ceased when he approached the right domino, leaving the man at
liberty to jest and talk nonsense for the amusement of the crowd.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
He had evidently a long string of ready-prepared witticisms. He
laughed at the dog for being so long in making up his mind as to
what it would be most judicious to play;&mdash;told him that he had
been so hospitably treated by the good Parisians, that it was evident
his brains were not so clear as they ought to be, &amp;c., &amp;c.: all which
verbiage I suspect the dog took as a confirmation that he was
making the selection his master wished. The man promised to call
upon me; but I was obliged to leave Paris sooner than I had expected,
and I never saw him again.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">EXCELLENCE EXPECTED.</div>

<p id="para_443"><span class="small">443. Our attention, however, perhaps you will think, ought to
be confined to instances of intelligence and high education in
sporting dogs. Well, then, in the next Chapter I will speak of
what some dogs of that class do in this, and some are <i>trained</i> to do
in other countries;&mdash;facts for the truth of which I can vouch, and
I hope the account will induce you to believe I am not unreasonable
in asserting that we have a right to require greater excellence
in our sporting dogs than what is now regarded by most of us as
satisfactory.</span></p>

<p id="para_444"><span class="small">444. Bears of the common species which we often see led
about, are very numerous in the hilly districts of some parts of
India. In rocky, nearly inaccessible places, the natives hunt them
with a strong-set wiry dog. This dog is trained to watch for his
opportunity, and leap very high upon the chest of the bear, and
seize his throat. You would, perhaps, think this the most disadvantageous
position which the dog could select, enabling Bruin to
crush him in his powerful embrace. Not so. The well-instructed
creature draws himself up so high that the bear, in lieu of crushing
his ribs, merely presses his hips,&mdash;and the bear&#8217;s arms, instead of
injuring his opponent are often his best protection; for the animals
frequently come rolling together to the foot of the hill, where the
hunters despatch poor Bruin with their spears.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BOAR AND POLYGAR DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_445"><span class="small">445. In other parts of India the natives chase the wild hog with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
a coarse dog of the Polygar breed. The dog is taught to seize the
hog between the hind-legs when he has turned his head to meet
some other assailant, and to retain the hold until the hunters come
up.</span></p>

<p id="para_446"><span class="small">446. Talking of India, however, I cannot help digressing. Why
should not more Europeans residing in that country, have dogs as
well-trained for <i>birds</i> as the Natives have for the bear and hog? I
have often thought what much finer sport I should have enjoyed,
when I was serving there, if I had then gained as much experience
in dog-breaking as I now have. As too many young fellows, belonging
both to the Queen&#8217;s and Company&#8217;s service, frequently
complain of their inability to kill time&mdash;&#40;time which so soon kills
them!&#41;&mdash;it is a pity more of them do not take to the innocent
amusement of dog-breaking. The broiling sun<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> makes all game
lie so close in India &#40;except very early in the morning, and towards
the close of day&#41; that the best beaters, unless the number be unusually
great, leave nearly a dozen head of game behind them for
every one that is sprung, especially in jungly ground. The evil is
partially, I allow, but very partially, remedied in grass-land, by
attaching numerous little bells to the long cord carried by the line
of beaters. I have heard of this plan being pursued in England
in the absence of dogs, or when the scent was unusually bad.</span></p>

<p id="para_447"><span class="small">447. The object at that time of my especial envy was a nondescript
belonging to an officer of the Company&#8217;s service, with whom
I used occasionally to shoot near Belgaum. The animal had, I
fancy, some cross of pointer in his composition; so little, however,
that he never pretended to point. He used just to &#8220;feather&#8221;
feebly when he happened to get near any game; and as he was a
wretchedly slow potterer, and never strayed &#40;for hunting it could
not be called&#41; far from his master, all that he did put up was well
within gun range. His owner thus got nearly twice as many shots
as any of his companions. How much his sport would have been
increased had he possessed a good dog!</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">ANGLO-INDIAN DOGS.</div>

<p id="para_448"><span class="small">448. Now there are some native dogs<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> in India with not a bad
nose &#40;those, for instance, which are employed to hunt the porcupine
at night&#41;, and a breed from them with an European pointer<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> would,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
doubtless, prove extremely useful. Their strength of constitution
would compensate for acknowledged inferiority in every other respect.
A cross with the Spanish Don would probably be the best,
and the easiest broken in, as he is so steady and full of point. But
the Hidalgo would be of little service out of the kennel. From
his natural inactivity and weight, he would soon knock up under
an Indian sun. Three or four pups would be enough for the dam
to rear. Those most like the sire should be preserved; and they
might be kept in good health, if they were occasionally treated to
a <i>little</i> calomel overnight, with castor oil in the morning, and
allowed full liberty to run about for an hour every morning and
evening. I knew some greyhounds of a purely English breed, but
born in the country, which were thus maintained in capital health.
They belonged to the only litter that the mother ever had. The
climate, which is generally fatal to England-born dogs, killed both
the parents within a year after their arrival in India. It is best that
the pups should be whelped in the latter part of the year, as they
would then acquire some strength before the setting in of the hottest
weather, and be of an age to commence hunting at the beginning
of the following cool season. The companionship of dogs in the
jungle adds much to the security of the pedestrians. A timid yelp or
a clamorous bark gives timely notice of the vicinity of every disagreeable,
dangerous neighbour, and enables the sportsman to take
a cool deliberate aim, instead of having to make a hurried snapshot
at some stealthy panther or tiger, or the far more formidable
foe, a solitary buffalo. The habit of placing the fore-finger alongside
the stock, and not letting it touch the trigger, until the moment
of firing, proves very valuable in these critical circumstances. Many
a barrel has gone off, even in the hands of an old sportsman, before
he properly covered some vital part of his first royal tiger. The
certainty of ignition afforded by a detonator gives great confidence
to the present generation of sportsmen. Even in the wettest
weather, the waterproof caps manufactured by Eley and others,
seem to insure an instantaneous fire.</span></p>

<p id="para_449"><span class="small">449. Great presence of mind in moments of unforeseen, sudden
peril is undoubtedly a gift; but calmness and self-possession, fortunately
for sportsmen seeking &#8220;large game&#8221; &#40;burrah shicar&#41;, as it
is technically termed in India, can be acquired by reflection and
habit.</span></p>

<p id="para_450"><span class="small">450. A friend and old fellow-passenger of mine, one of the
Colonels <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>,&mdash;a name that will long be remembered at Hythe&mdash;evinced
in 1816 as much coolness as I ever heard of. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
then on the staff at Ceylon, and used, while accompanying the
Governor on his annual tour throughout the island, to have magnificent
sport in places rarely visited by Europeans. Indeed, his
character as a slayer of elephants was so fully established that he
was often called &#8220;elephant-king.&#8221;</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">ROGUE-ELEPHANT.</div>

<p id="para_451"><span class="small">451. On the party arriving one morning within the Mahagampattoo
district, the Governor said to <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, &#8220;Surely you will not
attack the desperate brute that lately killed those villagers and
the two letter-carriers?&#8221; The sportsmen modestly replied, &#8220;I
cannot say, sir; perhaps I may.&#8221; Now it is well known that a
rogue-elephant is always a formidable animal; but one <i>recently</i>
driven from a herd by a stronger bull is particularly dangerous.
In his malignant rage he often wantonly attacks whatever he sees;
and there are several instances of his having displayed extraordinary
patience in waiting for imprisoned men who had climbed into trees,
or retreated into caves, to avoid his fury.</span></p>

<p id="para_452"><span class="small">452. The elephant the Governor referred to was, at that time,
the terror of the surrounding neighbourhood; for when maddened
by jealousy and rage at being expelled after a severe conflict from
the harem, and smarting from the blows and wounds inflicted by
his more powerful rival, he had ventured to attack an unfortunate
labourer, and finding how slight was the resistance offered, he had
since sought opportunities for wreaking his vengeance on man, of
whom he had now lost all his former instinctive dread.</span></p>

<p id="para_453"><span class="small">453. About four o&#8217;clock, as the Governor, Lady <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;g</span>, and the
staff, &amp;c., were seated at dinner, which was nearly over, a message
that caused some excitement among the hearers was delivered to
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>. The Governor inquired about it. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> explained
that the Shircarree set as a watch had reported that the much
dreaded &#8220;Rogue&#8221; had just left the jungle and appeared upon the
plain. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> asked leave to attack him. Lady <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;g</span> begged
that, escorted by a few gentlemen, she might be allowed to watch
his proceedings from some safe spot. This <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> acceded to, but
stipulated that he was then to be left entirely to himself. On
getting a view of the low ground, and observing several herds of
elephants scattered over the extensive plain, her ladyship became
nervous, and returned to the encampment. Her brother, Mr.
<span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;t</span> and Mr. G. &#40;now living in London&#41; remained; and <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>
placed them in a secure position amidst some trees standing too
close together to admit of the elephant&#8217;s forcing his large body
through, should he be merely wounded, and perchance take that
direction.</span></p>

<p id="para_454"><span class="small">454. After carefully examining the localities, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> made a
d&eacute;tour to prevent the &#8220;Rogue&#8221; from winding him. There was
some brushwood, but no trees, to cover his approach. The vindictive
solitary animal was apparently brooding over his wrongs in an
open space rich with the luxuriant vegetation consequent on tropical
rains. He began to feed, striking the ground with each fore-foot alternately,
in order to loosen the grass from the soil. He then collected
the herbage with his trunk; but before carrying the mass to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
mouth, shook it carefully to free the roots from earth. This gave
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> the opportunity, stealthily and creeping low, to get undetected
about twenty paces in rear of him. There he knelt and
anxiously awaited the turn of the head that should expose some
spot not completely protecting the brain.</span></p>

<p id="para_455"><span class="small">455. Long did he watch, for the elephant, when not engaged in
feeding, stood motionless, save an occasional whisk of his cord-like
tail, or the flopping of his huge ears. At times, however, he
would slightly bend his head when with his proboscis scattering
sand over his body, in order to drive off some troublesome insect;
at which moment the hopeful sportsman would noiselessly cock his
piece, but only to again half-cock it in disappointment.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">ELEPHANT KILLED.</div>

<p id="para_456"><span class="small">456. Messrs. B. and G. became impatient. They fancied the
elephant must have stolen away; and a peacock happening to fly
over their heads, they fired at it. On hearing the noise, the elephant
wheeled, and perceived <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span>. He curled his trunk under his
neck, lowered his head, and charged. The most vulnerable spot
was thus presented. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g&#8217;s</span> barrel was deliberately poised,&mdash;a
cool aim taken, and the trigger pulled;&mdash;but it yielded not!
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> felt, he told me, &#8220;a choking sensation&#8221;&mdash;certain death was
before him; but instantly remembering that he had replaced the
piece on half-cock, he brought it from his shoulder&mdash;full-cocked it&mdash;raised
it again to level&mdash;and with unshaken nerve, and unerring
precision, a second time covered the vulnerable spot. Down with a
tremendous crash dropped the ponderous brute, first on his knees,
then on his chest; and with such speed was he charging that he
almost made a complete somerset in the act of falling stone dead
near the feet of his comparatively puny conqueror&mdash;vanquished by
skill and cool intrepidity.</span></p>

<p id="para_457"><span class="small">457. The party on descending found <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> endeavouring to
climb up the enormous carcass. They feared the animal might be

with his ramrod in the direction the bullet had taken.</span></p>

<p id="para_458"><span class="small">458. Colonel W. &#40;the Q. Master General&#41;, who was of the party,

<p id="para_459"><span class="small">459. My friend&#8217;s nerves were so little affected by his narrow

so low as to align with the elbow, when the head would be in a
favourable position for a well-directed ball to penetrate to the

struck the elbow and fractured the bone. Darkness was gradually
coming on,&mdash;the river was full of alligators,&mdash;there was no bridge,&mdash;and

endeavouring to make use of the fractured limb by frequently
lifting it with his trunk and placing it in front.</span></p>

<p id="para_460"><span class="small">460. Colonel W., whose artistic sketch shows that he was an
undeniable hand at the pencil, whatever he might be with the rifle,
was ambitious of being able to say he had killed an elephant. He,
therefore, begged leave to give the wounded animal its <i>coup de
grace</i>. It was found wallowing in an adjacent buffalo hole. Colonel
W. got within twelve yards of it, but bespattered by the mud the
disabled beast threw over him&mdash;the novel and only defence it could
make&mdash;his aim was so uncertain, that, after all, <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> had to put
the sufferer out of its misery.</span></p>

<p id="para_461"><span class="small">461. Colonel W.&#8217;s ambition recalls to my mind a singular advertisement,
though I cannot think that even he would have answered
it had he been in London at the time. It appeared in the papers
many years ago, but was too ludicrous not to be still in the recollection
of many. A perfumer in Bishopsgate Street Without, gave
notice in conspicuous characters &#8220;to SPORTSMEN,&#8221; that a splendid
Bear was to be killed on his premises, at which they might
have a shot by paying,&mdash;I now forget what exact sum.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">ASIATIC AND AFRICAN ELEPHANTS.</div>

<p id="para_462"><span class="small">462. I am told that an examination of the skulls of the Asiatic
and African elephants would show a marked difference between the
two, and explain why the latter animal cannot be instantaneously
killed. In the Asiatic elephant there is a spot about the size of a
man&#8217;s hand between and somewhat above the eyes, where a bullet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
can easily penetrate to the brain when the head is carried low;
whereas the brain, it is said, of the African elephant is as effectually
guarded on the forehead as elsewhere. This might be inferred
from a perusal of Gordon Cumming&#8217;s exciting book. Murray
would not print many of the startling anecdotes related in the
manuscript, fearing they might throw discredit upon the work.
But it is, I think, to be regretted that he did not trust more to the
discernment of the public; and to the strong internal evidence of
truthfulness afforded in the descriptions given of the habits of the
various beasts which the author had singular opportunities of
observing.</span></p>

<p id="para_463"><span class="small">463. The mention of Gordon Cumming&#8217;s name, which is naturally
associated with feats of cool daring, leads one to speak of an old
fellow-sportsman of his at the Cape of Good Hope. Doubtless
there are men of whom it may be almost averred that they know
not the sensation of fear. Of this number was Gordon Cumming&#8217;s

took constant opportunities of encountering single-handed the real
lords of the forest in their own wild domain; and numerous are
the stories told by his brother officers of his hair-breadth escapes.
Gordon Gumming and he often shot together; and I have heard it
said that at a time when his left arm was so much injured as to be
perfectly useless, he went close up to a lion, which was standing
over Cumming&#8217;s prostrate body, and with his right hand aiming at
the animal&#8217;s heart made the Caffre boy behind him pull the deadly
trigger. And does not the little fellow&#8217;s heroic conduct, who
placed such implicit confidence in his master&#8217;s address and nerve,
claim much of our admiration!</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">ENCOUNTER WITH LION.</div>

<p id="para_465"><span class="small">465. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;e&#8217;s</span> courage was reckless. Having more than once
failed in getting a shot at a formidable lion which had committed
great ravages, and was reported to be of immense size, he determined
upon tracking the beast to his rocky fastness, and forcing
him to a hand-to-hand combat in his very den. One morning a
recent spoor<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> enabled him to find the cave he sought, the entrance
of which was so contracted that in order not wholly to exclude the
light, he was compelled to lie down and crawl in upon his elbows.
Pushing the muzzle of his gun before him, slowly, inch by inch he
crept on, expecting every moment to see the large, glaring, cat-like
eye-balls, or to hear the menacing growl. His sight becoming more
accustomed to the gloom, he was enabled to scan every crevice, and
was satisfied that the master of the habitation could not have yet
returned from his nocturnal rambles. Bones of large size were
strewn about, as well as others whose suspicious appearance prompted
the involuntary reflection that the absent animal was in very
truth the dreaded &#8220;man-eater&#8221; who had so long baffled all pursuit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Nothing daunted, but rather aroused by the thought to an increased
determination to destroy the monster, <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;e</span> resolved quietly to
await his return.</span></p>

<p id="para_466"><span class="small">466. Hour after hour passes. The shades of evening fall. The
bark of the jackal and the howlings of the hy&aelig;na, showing the
advance of night, meet his ear,&mdash;but not the longed-for roar of the
expected lion. Surely he will again seek his lair while the bright
moon yet favours the intrepid sportsman. No&mdash;he comes not. Complete
darkness sets in&mdash;darkness intense in that deep recess;&mdash;but
ere long the discordant screams of the peacock announce the early
dawn, and after a while the hot beams of the sun again hush all
into silence, save the busy hum of innumerable insects. Horrible
suspense! The weary hours drag on&mdash;still he returns not; and
there still sits <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, but not the man he was. Anxious excitement&mdash;want
of sleep&mdash;and, above all, the deprivation of bodily
stimulants, have done their work. He was agitated and unnerved.
To quote his own words when afterwards recounting the adventure,
he &#8220;would have given worlds to have been away, or to have had a
flask of brandy.&#8221; What madness, he thought, could have tempted
him to seek such certain destruction? Had the taint of his feet
raised the animal&#8217;s suspicions? Was his presence detected? And
was the shaggy monster watching outside, crouching low, ready to
spring when his victim should be forced by hunger to emerge? Quit
he dare not; yet to remain with nerves unstrung was terrible. In
his diseased state of mind imagination conjured up awfully harrowing
scenes in which man in his feebleness had succumbed;&mdash;and
was it really decreed that his crushed bones should mingle
unhonoured and unnoticed with the heap around him? Hours that
seemed days of torture passed away&mdash;again the sun reached the
zenith&mdash;again it sets&mdash;and again it shines upon the remains of
huge limbs, and upon those of slighter mould that bear a fearfully
close resemblance to his own! The sun has sunk behind the summit
of the distant hills, already the short twilight commences. Can
he survive another night of horrors, or shall he, risking all, rush
forth.</span></p>

<p id="para_467"><span class="small">467. Suddenly a deep and angry growl is heard. It acts as
music upon his soul&mdash;his nerves are at once restored to their
pristine firmness&mdash;strong is his pulse&mdash;steady his hand; his countenance
lights up with hope and animation; and as the cave is
darkened by the entrance of its legitimate but no longer dreaded
owner, the favourite barrels are deliberately levelled with the accustomed
deadly aim.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">ENCOUNTER WITH BOAR.</div>

<p id="para_468"><span class="small">468. The Hindoos, who are naturally an inoffensive timid race,
have an almost fabulous reverence for the courage of Europeans,
whom they often term fighting devils&mdash;an epithet applied in no disparaging
way, but, on the contrary, as the highest of compliments.
The Assistant-surgeon &#40;<span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;h</span>&#41; and a Lieutenant &#40;<span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;n</span>&#41;, of a
regiment to which I once belonged on the Indian establishment,
were travelling up the country. On arriving early one morning at
their breakfast tent &#40;which had been sent forward as usual the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
preceding evening&#41;, they were met by the Cutwal and principal
men of the small village, bearing a trifling present of fruit. After
many salaams, the deputation said that the villagers were in the
greatest distress,&mdash;that an enormous wild boar and a sow had taken
up their abode in the neighbouring sugar plantation,&mdash;that the crop
was fully ripe, but that whenever the labourers ventured in to cut
the canes they were driven out by a charge of the swine; that the
whole body, women as well as men, had united more than once in
an attempt to alarm the intruders with the noise of tomtoms, cholera
horns, firing of matchlocks, &amp;c., but that the unclean brutes would
not leave, and that the inhabitants had nearly resigned all hope of
saving the crop, when they had the happiness of hearing that an
English officer was expected, who, as a matter of course, could have
no objection to shoot the vicious animals. <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;n</span> and <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;h</span>
willingly consented to start directly after breakfast. The former
was a keen sportsman, but the latter had never fired a gun; however,
he said he would do his best; and being furnished with an
old musket, he sallied forth &#8220;at fixed bayonets.&#8221; Almost the
moment they entered the cover a crashing noise warned them to be
on their guard. The boar, without an instant&#8217;s hesitation, rushed
at the invaders, making a special selection of the individual least
accustomed to arms. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;h</span>, in no way daunted, dropped upon
his right knee,&mdash;brought his firelock to the charging position,&mdash;and
calmly waited to pull trigger until the formidable beast was so close
upon the bayonet, that he knocked the piece out of <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;h&#8217;s</span> grasp,
and sent him spinning heels over head. On regaining his feet,
<span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;h</span> found that his formidable adversary was already dead; the
bayonet, much bent in the encounter, was buried deep in his huge
chest; and subsequent examination showed that the ball had
severed his heart into two nearly equal portions. The sow had
apparently quickly become aware of the mischance that had befallen
her mate, for she ignominiously fled from the field at her best pace.
In reply to the thanks, congratulations, and encomiums bestowed
upon the worthy Assistant-surgeon for his success and admirable
coolness, he quietly observed, that all was well that ended well;
that it was an awful beast; and that he would take precious good
care never voluntarily to encounter such another;&mdash;that he had
had his first shot, and fervently hoped it would be his last.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">GREYHOUNDS AND KANGAROO.</div>

<p id="para_469"><span class="small">469. To hark back, however, to our subject. Greyhounds of a
large rough kind are trained in some parts of Australia to course
the kangaroo. A kangaroo when he is brought to bay<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> would
disable a great number of dogs, however bold and strong they
might be, should they incautiously attack him in front: for while
he is sitting upon his hind-quarters, or standing upright, he can by
one blow, or rather strike of his hind-leg, which is furnished with
huge claws, tear open the strongest greyhound from the chest downwards;
and many dogs have been thus killed. As soon, therefore,
as a large kangaroo is seen, a <i>well-educated</i> brace of greyhounds are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
slipped. For some time, by a succession of enormous bounds, the
animal keeps far ahead of his pursuers&mdash;especially when running
up hill, where he is as much favoured by his long hind-legs as a
hare is by hers,&mdash;and all are soon lost to the sight of unmounted
hunters. When he has been overtaken and brought to bay, one of
the trained dogs keeps him there; and this he does barking round
and round him, threatening every moment to fly at him. The other
dog returns to the hunters, and leads them to the spot where his
companion is detaining the kangaroo: and so completely does the
noisy assailant engage the attention of the unfortunate beast, that
the hunters are frequently enabled to approach unperceived, and
stun him with a blow over the head. An old kangaroo is there
termed by the hunters &#8220;an old man;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the flesh of a young one
is, however, by many considered very delicate eating. A powerful
dog will kill a small kangaroo single-handed; and if properly taught,
will then seek for his master, and conduct him to the body.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">GREYHOUNDS, FALCON, AND DEER.</div>

<p id="para_470"><span class="small">470. In Persia and many parts of the East greyhounds are taught
to assist the falcon in the capture of deer. When brought within
good view of a herd the bird is flown, and at the same moment the
dog is slipped. The rapid sweep of the falcon soon carries him far
in advance. It is the falcon who makes the selection of the intended
victim,&mdash;which appears to be a matter of chance,&mdash;and a
properly-trained greyhound will give chase to none other, however
temptingly close the alarmed animals may pass him. The falcon is
instructed to aim at the head only of the gazelle, who soon becomes
bewildered; sometimes receiving considerable injury from the quick
stroke of its daring adversary. Before long the gazelle is overtaken
by the greyhound. It is not always easy to teach a dog to avoid
injuring the bird, which is so intent upon its prey as utterly to disregard
the approach of the hound. Death would probably be the
penalty adjudged to him for so heinous an offence; for a well-trained
falcon is of great value. You can readily imagine that neither it
nor the greyhound could be properly broken unless the instructor
possessed much judgment and perseverance. The sport is very
exciting; but the spectator must be well-mounted, and ride boldly
who would closely watch the swift, varying evolutions of the assailing
party, and the sudden evasions of the helpless defendant. The
education of this falcon is conducted on the same principle as that
of the cheeta.&mdash;&#40;Note to <a href="#para_284">284</a>.&#41; The lure is a stuffed gazelle. It is
placed at gradually increased distances. The raw meat is fixed
between its eyes, and the concluding lessons terminate with the
sacrifice of a few tame or maimed deer; a portion of whose warm
flesh is given to the bird as a reward for his aid in recapturing the
unfortunate creatures.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BARBUDA CUB.</div>

<p id="para_471"><span class="small">471. An officer, quartered at Antigua, used occasionally to obtain
permission to shoot on an island called Barbuda, in the possession
of Sir Bethel Codrington. It is a strange spot,&mdash;a coral rock just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
emerging from the sea, its highest point being no more than one
hundred and twenty feet above the water. The horses, cattle, and
everything on the island are wild, save the manager and two overseers,
its only white inhabitants. The former &#40;I speak of the year
1835&#41; was a splendidly built man, not very refined, but full of
energy, an excellent shot, and an indefatigable sportsman. No
Indian had a keener eye for a trail. A turned leaf or a broken
twig told him the path, and almost the distance, of the hog or deer
which he was pursuing through the dark intricacies of stunted trees,
cactus, and long grass, with which the island is, in a great measure,
covered. A small mangy-looking mongrel, with a long thin muzzle,
and lanky body, always accompanied him. The sagacity of this
brute, and his powers of scenting game, were most remarkable.
He generally walked about ten yards in front of his master, and
suddenly throwing his nose high in the air, would quicken his pace,
and trot up wind. Gradually again his pace would slacken,&mdash;the
trot was changed to a walk, the walk to stealthy creeping, when he
would raise each foot with the greatest caution, putting it down as
noiselessly as though shod with velvet, most carefully avoiding the
crisp leaves and dry twigs, for fear of making the slightest sound.
Presently he would stand stock-still &#40;the inclination to point is, I
think, more general among dogs than many men suppose&#41; and look
at his master; but he never did this unless the game was well
within shot. His master would now peer closely round, and his
eagle-eye never failed to detect the tip of a horn, or a dappled spot,
showing where a fallow-deer was feeding. If there was a flock of
Guinea-birds,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> &#40;which are numerous in Barbuda,&#41; the sagacious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
little creature would wait until the gun was close to him, and then,
to prevent their running, would dash in and spring them.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">CUR AND WILD HOG.</div>

<p id="para_472"><span class="small">472. If a hog was in the wind, the cur dashed off immediately,
following the animal until it stopped at bay, when a shrill bark
warned the sportsman of the scene of action. The tiny animal had
many a scar on his rugged hide, cut by hogs, with whose ears and
heels he frequently took liberties; but, up to the time that the
officer left that part of the world, the dog had escaped serious injury
by his good generalship and activity. He certainly had a very just
estimate of his own physical powers, for with young porkers he
stood on little ceremony, rushing into them at once, and worrying
and holding them until the hunter came to his assistance.</span></p>

<p id="para_473"><span class="small">473. You might draw a useful moral from this long story by
considering for a moment what kind of sport our Creole acquaintance
would have had, and what number of Guinea-birds, wild hogs, and
deer &#40;capital shot as he was&#41; he would have killed in the year, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>

of figures employed in the enumeration.</span></p>

<p id="para_474"><span class="small">474. You may think the foregoing a tough yarn, but I have now

<div class="pageheader">A NEWFOUNDLAND FISHING.</div>

<p id="para_475"><span class="small">475. At certain seasons of the year the streams in some parts of
North America, not far from the coast, are filled with fish to an
extent you could scarcely believe, unless you had witnessed it&mdash;and
now comes the Munchausen story. A real Newfoundland, belonging
to a farmer who lived near one of those streams, used, at such times,
to keep the house well supplied with fish. He thus managed it:&mdash;He
was perfectly black, with the exception of a white fore-foot, and
for hours together he would remain almost immoveable on a small
rock which projected into the stream, keeping his white foot hanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
over the ledge as a lure to the fish. He remained so stationary
that it acted as a very attractive bait; and whenever curiosity or
hunger tempted any unwary fish to approach too close, the dog
plunged in, seized his victim, and carried him off to the foot of
a neighbouring tree; and, on a successful day, he would catch a
great number.</span></p>

<p id="para_476"><span class="small">476. I have another anecdote of a young Newfoundland, told me
by General Sir <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;d</span> <span class="glue">D&mdash;&mdash;s</span>, to whose scientific attainments
the two sister-services, the army and the navy, are both so greatly
indebted. He bred the dog in America, having most fortunately
taken the dam from England; for, to her address in swimming, and
willingness to &#8220;fetch,&#8221; he and his surviving shipwrecked companions
were, under Providence, chiefly indebted for securing many pieces
of salt pork that had drifted from the ill-fated vessel, and which
constituted their principal food during their six weeks&#8217; miserable
detention on an uninhabited island.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">NEWFOUNDLAND AND FOX.</div>

<p id="para_477"><span class="small">477. At a station where he was afterwards quartered as a subaltern,
in &#8217;98, not far from the falls of Niagara, the soldiers kept a tame
fox. The animal&#8217;s kennel was an old cask, to which he was attached
by a long line and swivel. The Newfoundland and the fox
soon scraped an acquaintance, which, in due course, ripened into an
intimacy.</span></p>

<p id="para_478"><span class="small">478. One day that Sir <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;d</span> went to the barracks, not seeing
anything of the fox, he gave the barrel a kick, saying to a man
standing by, &#8220;Your fox is gone!&#8221; This sudden knock at the back-door
of his house so alarmed the sleeping inmate, that he bolted
forth with such violence as to snap the light cord. Off he ran. The
soldiers felt assured that he would return, but Sir <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;d</span>, who
closely watched the frightened animal, had the vexation of observing
that he made direct for the woods.</span></p>

<p id="para_479"><span class="small">479. Sir <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;d</span> bethought him to hie on Neptune after Reynard,
on the chance of the friends coming back together in amicable converse.
It would, however, appear that the attractions of kindred
&#40;more probably of freedom&#41; had greater influence than the claims
of friendship; for, instead of the Newfoundland&#8217;s returning with
Pug as a <i>voluntary</i> companion, after a time, to the surprise and
delight of many spectators, the dog was descried, with the end of
the rope in his mouth, forcibly dragging along the disappointed fox,
who was struggling, manfully but fruitlessly, against a fresh introduction
to his military quarters.</span></p>

<p id="para_480"><span class="small">480. &#8220;Nep&#8221; was properly lauded and caressed for his sagacity;
and Sir <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;d</span> was so satisfied that he would always fetch back
the fox perfectly uninjured and unworried, however much excited
in the chase, that the next day, after turning out Reynard, he
permitted the officers to animate and halloo on the dog to their
utmost. When slipped, though all eagerness for the fun in hand,
&#8220;Nep&#8221; took up the trail most accurately, hunted it correctly, and
in due course, agreeably to his owner&#8217;s predictions, dragged back
the poor prisoner in triumph, having, as on the previous occasion,
merely seized the extremity of the cord.</span></p>

<p id="para_481"><span class="small">481. For the following anecdote I am indebted to Sir <span class="glue">G&mdash;&mdash;e</span>
<span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;k</span>, the intrepid and scientific navigator, whose name will be
mentioned as long as British deeds of the present century are cited,
descriptive of bold daring and perseverance in surmounting the
greatest difficulties.</span></p>

<p id="para_482"><span class="small">482. &#8220;On the 8th of September, 1834, after a laborious morning
spent in ascending a part of the Thlew-&#277;e-ch&#333;h-dezeth, or Back
River, we were detained by the portage of the &#8216;Cascades.&#8217; While
the men were actively employed in carrying the things across, I was
equally busy in the tent, working a series of observations which had
just been obtained for longitude, &amp;c.</span></p>

<p id="para_483"><span class="small">483. &#8220;A little dog, a species of terrier, called &#8216;Muta&#8217; from her
silent, quiet habits, was my only companion. She had been the
faithful follower of my party to the polar sea, and, independently of
her value as a good watch, was not only a pet of mine, but had
managed to become a great favourite with all the others.</span></p>

<p id="para_484"><span class="small">484. &#8220;Muta had left the tent for upwards of an hour, but returned
in great haste, bustled about inside, rubbed against me, and with
eyes bright and eager stood looking in my face. Finding I paid no
attention to her, she rushed out&mdash;came back, however, quickly;
and standing over the gun, which was near me, again looked
imploringly at me. Once more she sprung outside, and barked
anxiously.</span></p>

<p id="para_485"><span class="small">485. &#8220;Still I continued my calculations; and perhaps twenty
minutes might have elapsed when Muta, warm and panting, leapt
upon me&mdash;ran to the gun&mdash;then to the opening of the tent, and
evinced such very unusual restlessness that I could not help fancying
something must be wrong. Being alone, I thought it well to be
prepared, and accordingly put a ball into my second barrel,&mdash;there
always was one in the first,&mdash;and followed her out.</span></p>

<p id="para_486"><span class="small">486. &#8220;Her joy was unbounded, and perfectly noiselessly she led
me such a distance that I thought she was deceiving me, and I
chidingly told her so; but she still persisted in going forward,
pleased though excited. I walked on a little further, when conceiving
I was but losing my time I turned back. She ran round
to intercept me, and so earnestly resisted my attempts to retrace my
steps, that I yielded to the appeal, and again consented to accompany
her.</span></p>

<p id="para_487"><span class="small">487. &#8220;She brought me to the edge of a gully, fully half-a-mile
from the tent, partly sheltered by willows. Here she stopped.
Thinking she had tricked me, I began to reproach her, on which she
darted like lightning into the underwood, barking furiously, when,
to my great surprise, out rushed a large musk bull, which unluckily
I only wounded, to Muta&#8217;s manifest disappointment, and my own
great annoyance.</span></p>

<p id="para_488"><span class="small">488. &#8220;Poor Muta&#8217;s sad fate is recorded in the 462d page of my

in a glass case within the walls of the United Service Institution.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_489"><span class="small">489. At my request, Sir <span class="glue">G&mdash;&mdash;e</span> kindly drew the spirited sketch,
which I have had engraved, of the scene he so vividly described.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">CAPTAIN AND SUWARROW.</div>

<p id="para_490"><span class="small">490. Dining one day at the hospitable board of Lord <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;f</span>,
he told me, that many years ago an uncle of his, an excellent sportsman,
lent him a brace of short-haired English dogs, yclept &#8220;Captain&#8221;
and &#8220;Suwarrow,&#8221;&mdash;martial names! yet not inappropriate, you will
think, when you hear some of their feats of strategy. &#8220;Captain,&#8221;
moreover, had other warlike propensities; he was a close-knit,
powerful dog, and there was no peace in any kennel he ever entered
until its boldest inmates had conceded to him all the privileges of
commander-in-chief.</span></p>

<p id="para_491"><span class="small">491. Lord <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;f</span> and a friend had obtained permission to shoot
on a considerable part of an extensive valley in Perthshire, lying at
the foot of &#8220;Schiehallion;&#8221; but unfortunately they had not the sole
right,&mdash;a similar favour had been granted to a lame man, but no
<i>lame</i> sportsman, who for some days greatly annoyed them. Start
when they would, and take what line they might, Dot-and-go-one
with his old pointer was sure to be on the heather before them.</span></p>

<p id="para_492"><span class="small">492. &#8220;Captain&#8221; and &#8220;Suwarrow&#8221; bore this for some time with
greater <i>apparent</i> patience than the gentlemen. On one occasion,
however, when the inferiority of the ground they were compelled to
take was more than usually obvious, &#8220;Captain&#8217;s&#8221; blood was fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
roused,&mdash;he could stand it no longer. Leaving his companion, he
crossed at full speed to the other side of the valley,&mdash;not, as might
possibly be surmised, to wreak his vengeance upon the old pointer,&mdash;but,
strange to say, to hunt at his best pace the good ground in
front of his rival, and <i>raise</i>, not <i>point</i>, every grouse he could find.
When he conceived he had done enough mischief, or perhaps thought
he had driven a fair proportion of birds to Lord<span class="glue"> M&mdash;&mdash;f&#8217;s</span> side of
the valley, he quietly returned to his usual duties&mdash;duties which,
be it remarked, he always performed most steadily. As an evidence&mdash;on
the evening of that very day, instead of <i>pointing</i>, as was his
wont, he <i>dropped</i>, on unexpectedly getting into the midst of a pack,
and did not stir an inch until all the birds had successively risen.
You will surely think <i>his</i> right to be considered a first-rate tactician
is fully proved:&mdash;when you read <a href="#para_530">530</a>, you will perhaps allow that
&#8220;Suwarrow&#8221; has an equally good, if not superior, claim to the
title.</span></p>

<p id="para_493"><span class="small">493. And will not these evidences of great sagacity and, except
in the few last cases, instances of good breaking&mdash;and they might be
multiplied, I was nearly saying, <i>ad infinitum</i>, for every sportsman
could furnish some&mdash;convince you, that it is our own fault, if our
high-bred pointers, setters, and retrievers &#40;which can scarcely be
surpassed in docility and intelligence&#41;, are indifferently educated?
It is not that <i>they</i> cannot understand, but that <i>we</i>, either for want of
patience or reflection, cannot make ourselves understood. The fault
is <i>ours</i>, not <i>theirs</i>. They might, indeed, almost be taught anything&mdash;even
things quite opposed to their nature&mdash;if we did but act more
reasonably, and were not in most cases supinely content to stop so
very far short of perfection, apparently grudging a little additional
trouble.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">RAP.</div>

<p id="para_494"><span class="small">494. In the &#8220;Sporting Magazine&#8221; for May, 1834, a likeness is
given of an admirable pointer named &#8220;Rap,&#8221; of whom it is recorded
that &#8220;he often hunted in the woods with springers and terriers, all
which time he played in both characters, and in both excelled. No
sooner, however, had he returned to his especial occupation, as a
pointer, than he became as steady as ever.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_495"><span class="small">495. I knew intimately an excellent shot &#40;T. <span class="glue">F&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, of the 76th&#41;,
who, some years ago, during one of the many disturbances in County
Tipperary, was quartered with a detachment of men at a gentleman&#8217;s
house, in rather a wild part of the country. The proprietor
kept a small scratch-pack of harriers, with which the officer&#8217;s pointer,
called Shot, became very intimate. When the hunting season commenced,
Shot accompanied them to the field, joined in the chase,
and performed uncommonly well; indeed, he frequently led the
pack, and yet, singular to say, he continued as steady as possible
when he was shot to. As you may well suppose, it was a source of
much fun and laughter to the Nimrods to see, regularly hunting
with their harriers, a dog which possibly had stanchly pointed at
birds the preceding day.</span></p>

<p id="para_496"><span class="small">496. Though I had bred and educated him myself,&mdash;he was the
dog of which I spoke &#40;<a href="#para_139">139</a>&#41; as behaving so well on the Galtee mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
when first shown game,&mdash;no one could be more surprised than
I was at hearing of so novel a display of intelligence. It is partly
to be accounted for by the fact, that none of his high animal spirits
and self-confidence had been destroyed by severity in breaking. I
can conscientiously aver that I do not think I whipped him more
than twice in the whole course of his training, and I am certain not
once harshly; and his next owner was equally kind,&mdash;I might more
correctly say, equally judicious.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">MR. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;E&#8217;S</span> DROPPER.</div>

<p id="para_497"><span class="small">497. As a dog that loves you, and possesses proper self-confidence,&mdash;though,
at the same time, he entertains due respect for your
authority,&mdash;will always exert himself to the best of his abilities
to please, it remains but for you to direct those abilities aright.
&#8220;Shot,&#8221; you see, <i>pointed</i> and <i>hunted</i> on alternate days. A little
bitch, that I knew, would, on the same day, set alternately different
kinds of game, according to the wishes of her master. She belonged
to a Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, near Templemore, and, with the exception that
she had no established judicious range, was one of the most killing
dogs to be met with in a long drive. She was an ugly, short-tailed
dropper; in appearance not worth three half-crowns. She was
capital on snipe; but on the bogs, if you were in expectation of
meeting with grouse, and, in consequence, refused to fire at one or
two snipes, and slightly scolded her for pointing them, she would
immediately leave off noticing them, confining herself entirely to
hunting for grouse. If you shot a snipe, and showed it to her, she
would immediately recommence seeking for the long-bills. But this
would be a dangerous lesson to teach a dog ever likely to be required
on the moors. A dog trained for grouse should invariably be rated
whenever he notices snipe; lest, after toiling up the side of a mountain
on a broiling day, in expectation of hearing the exciting
&#8220;Whirr-r whirr-r,&#8221; you be only greeted with the disappointing
&#8220;Skeap, skeap.&#8221; On the other hand, if you live in the lowlands,
and think you may hereafter wish to take your dog out snipe-shooting,
make him occasionally point one in the early part of his
education. It is often difficult to bring a partridge-dog to notice
snipe, whereas a snipe-dog will readily acknowledge partridge on
account of the stronger scent.</span></p>

<p id="para_498"><span class="small">498. Many sportsmen are of opinion that droppers inherit more
of the bad than the good qualities of their parents; but occasionally
one of a litter, like Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e&#8217;s</span> bitch, turns out an admirable dog,
and proves a valuable exception to the supposed rule. Sometime
since I heard an officer of the Engineers expatiating upon the
excellent qualities of a dropper &#40;by his pointer &#8220;Guy&#8221;&#41; out of a
Russian setter, which, as he said, belonged to me many years ago:
but he was mistaken. I never possessed one. I wish I had; for I
hear the breed is capital,&mdash;that they are very easily broken,&mdash;are
very intelligent,&mdash;have excellent noses, and great endurance, but not
much speed,&mdash;and never forget what has been once taught them: in
this respect more resembling pointers than our setters, which are
often wild at the beginning of a season. Could we, by judicious
crossing, improve them half as much as we did the old heavy

however, very difficult to procure them even in Russia of a pure
breed; for so few sportsmen in that country think of shooting
according to our system, that but little attention is paid to their
fine setters.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">RIVAL KEEPERS.</div>

<p id="para_499"><span class="small">499. If your patience is not exhausted, you shall hear &#40;as told me
by an old commanding officer of mine, Major <span class="glue">S&mdash;&mdash;n</span>&#41; how, many
years ago, a bet was decided in the Highlands, as to the perfection
in dog-breaking attained by two rival keepers. It was in the month
of August, and there was plenty of game. The dogs produced by
the two competitors performed so brilliantly,&mdash;were hunted so noiselessly,&mdash;quartered
their ground so systematically and independently,&mdash;and
worked so zealously, yet cautiously, that the awarding of the
palm seemed to be a difficult matter. At length one of the keepers
obtained the decision of the umpires in his favour by the following
feat. He made his three dogs, in obedience to a low whistle and a
sign, at a moment when all three were separately setting, retreat
from their several points without flushing any of the birds, and take
up each other&#8217;s points, each dog remaining stationary until he was
individually shot over. This great command, I suppose, but I
cannot assert it positively, must have been gained by much such
kennel discipline as is described in <a href="#para_30">30</a>. It would appear, too, as if
a distinct whistle or note had been employed for each dog &#40;<a href="#para_505">505</a>&#41;.</span></p>

<p id="para_500"><span class="small">500. I only advocate instruction that is really useful; therefore,
I merely mention this instance of excellent breaking as another
evidence of the great perfection to which our well-bred dogs <i>can</i> be
brought: and as it is certain they can reach such perfection, I think
you will admit that every <i>high-priced dog</i> ought to be far better
educated than is customary. Indeed, I trust, if you are an enthusiast
on the subject, that you will not only agree with me in requiring
that he be as fully made as I have described, and as I am of opinion
is absolutely necessary &#40;<a href="#para_393">393</a>&#41;, but that occasionally you will wish
him to be yet further instructed in some of the still higher accomplishments
or refinements which, if you are willing, we will now
proceed to consider.</span></p>

<p class="center">A DISTINGUISHING WHISTLE FOR EACH DOG.</p>

<p id="para_501">501. Though you may have only begun to shoot last
season, have you not often wished to attract the attention
of one of your two dogs, and make him hunt in a
particular part of the field, but, for fear of alarming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
birds, have been unwilling to call out his name, and
have felt loth to whistle to him, lest you should bring
away at the same time the other dog, who was zealously
hunting exactly where you considered him most likely
to find birds.</p>

<div class="pageheader">WHISTLES.</div>

<p id="para_502">502. Again: have the dogs never been hunting close
together instead of pursuing distinct beats; and has it
not constantly happened, on your whistling with the
view to separate them, that <i>both</i> have turned their heads
in obedience to the whistle, and <i>both</i> on your signal
changed the direction of their beat, but still the <i>two
together</i>? And have you not, in despair of ever parting
them by merely whistling and signalling, given the
lucky birds &#40;apparently in the most handsome manner,
as if scorning to take any ungenerous advantage&#41; fair
notice of the approach of the guns by shouting out the
name of one of the dogs.</p>

<p id="para_503">503. Or, if one dog was attentive to the whistle, did
he not gradually learn to disregard it from observing
that his companion was never chidden for neglecting to
obey it?&mdash;and did not such laxity more and more confirm
both in habits of disobedience?</p>

<p id="para_504">504. I believe several of my readers will be constrained
to answer these questions in the affirmative;
and, further, I think their own experience will remind
them of many occasions, both on moor and stubble when
birds were wild, on which they have wished to attract
the notice of a particular dog &#40;perhaps running along a
hedge, or pottering over a recent haunt; or hunting
down wind towards marked game&#41; by <i>whistling</i> instead
of calling out his name, but have been unwilling to do
so, lest the other dogs should likewise obey the shrill
sound to which all were equally accustomed.</p>

<div class="pageheader">DIFFERENT NOTES.</div>

<p id="para_505">505. Now, in breaking young dogs, you could, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
using whistles of dissimilar calls, easily avoid the
liability of these evils; and by invariably employing a
particular whistle for each dog to summon him separately
to his food &#40;<a href="#para_30">30</a>&#41;, each would distinguish his own whistle
as surely as every dog knows his own master&#8217;s whistle,
and as hounds learn their names. Dogs not only know
their own names, but instantly know by the pronunciation
when it is uttered by a stranger. To prevent
mistakes, each dog&#8217;s name might be marked on his own
whistle. You might have two whistles, of very different
sound, on one short stock. Indeed, <i>one</i> whistle would
be sufficient for two dogs, if you invariably sounded the
same two or three sharp short notes for one dog, and as
invariably gave a sustained note for the other. Nay,
the calls could thus be so diversified, that one whistle
might be used for even more than two dogs.</p>

<p id="para_506"><span class="small">506. Whoever has heard the boatswain of a man-of-war piping
all hands on deck, must think his whistle, from the variety of its
tones, almost a musical instrument; but it could not well be
employed for dogs, as they would not understand it when sounded
by any one but their master.</span></p>

<p id="para_507"><span class="small">507. Railways have led to the introduction of new whistles.
Porteous, the band-master at Chelsea College &#40;whose Light Infantry
Field Pipe is well-known to military men&#41;, has exercised his ingenious
talents in making several, but they are too shrill to be of
much service to the sportsman. The acorn &#40;or bell pattern&#41; has,
however, a much softer tone, yet it, too, makes an awful noise.</span></p>

<p>But whatever whistle you choose to employ, be sure,
both in and out of the field, to sound it softly whenever
the dog is near you. Indeed, you would act judiciously
to make it a constant rule, wherever he may be, <i>never to
whistle louder than is really requisite</i>, otherwise &#40;as I
think I before remarked&#41; he will, comparatively speaking,
pay little attention to its summons, when, being at
a distance, he hears it but faintly.</p>

<p id="para_508"><span class="small">508. I wrote to Mr. Porteous, explaining how much a whistle
was wanted that might be used by the most unmusical person, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
give distinct unvarying sounds, so that no dog could mistake his
own whistle, let it be blown by whom it might. He at once understood
what was required, and has invented one with a slide that
answers well for two dogs. He told me that he was making further
improvements, and expected to contrive one which would answer
for as many as three or four dogs. Messrs. Stevens, Darlington
Works, Southwark-bridge Road, are the manufacturers.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BACKING THE GUN.</div>

<p class="center">TO BACK THE GUN.</p>

<p id="para_509">509. In shooting, especially late in the season, you
will often mark down a bird, and feel assured that you
stand a better chance of getting a shot at it if the dogs
cease hunting whilst you approach it. You can teach
your dog to do this by holding up your right hand
<i>behind</i> you when you mark down a bird, saying at the
same time, &#8220;Toho,&#8221; in an earnest, quiet voice, and
carrying your gun as if you were prepared to shoot.
He will soon begin, I really must say it, to <i>back you</i>,&mdash;for
he actually will be backing you, ludicrous as the expression
may sound. After a few times he will do so on
the signal, without your speaking at all; and he will be
as pleased, as excited, and as stanch, as if he were
backing an old dog. Making him &#8220;drop&#8221; will not effect
your object; for, besides that it in no way increases his
intelligence, you may wish him to follow at a respectful
distance, while you are stealing along the banks of some
stream, &amp;c. Ere long he will become as sensible as
yourself that any noise would alarm the birds, and you
will soon see him picking his steps to avoid the crisp
leaves, lest their rustling should betray him. I have
even heard of a dog whose admirable caution occasionally
led him, when satisfied that his point was observed, to
crawl behind a bush, or some other shelter, to screen<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
himself from the notice of the birds.</p>

<p id="para_510">510. The acquisition of this accomplishment&mdash;and it
is easily taught to a young dog previously made steady
in backing another &#40;it should not be attempted before&#41;&mdash;will
often secure you a duck, or other wary bird, which
the dog would otherwise, almost to a certainty, spring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
out of gun-shot. If you should &#8220;soho&#8221; a hare, and wish
to kill one, you will have an excellent opportunity of
practising this lesson.</p>

<p id="para_511"><span class="small">511. In America there is a singular duck, called, from its often
alighting on trees, the Wood-duck. I have killed some of these
beautiful, fast-flying birds, while they were seated on logs overhanging
the water, which I could not have approached within
gun-shot had the dog not properly backed the gun when signalled
to, and cautiously crept after me, still remaining far in the rear.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">POINT RESUMED.</div>

<p class="center">TO RETREAT FROM A POINT AND RESUME IT.</p>

<p id="para_512">512. Amidst coppices, osiers, or broom&mdash;indeed, sometimes
on a rough moor&mdash;you will occasionally lose sight
of a dog, and yet be unwilling to call him, feeling assured
that he is somewhere steadily pointing; and being
vexatiously certain that, when he hears your whistle, he
will either leave his point, not subsequently to resume
it, or &#40;which is far more probable&#41; amuse himself by
raising the game before he joins you. There are
moments when you would give guineas if he would
retreat from his point, come to you on your whistling,
lead you towards the bird, and there resume his point.</p>

<p id="para_513">513. This accomplishment &#40;and in many places abroad
its value is almost inappreciable&#41; can be taught him,
if he is under great command, by your occasionally
bringing him to heel from a point when he is within
sight and near you, and again putting him on his
point. You will begin your instruction in this accomplishment
when the dog is pointing quite close to you.
On subsequent occasions, you can gradually increase the
distance, until you arrive at such perfection that you can
let him be out of sight when you call him. When he is
first allowed to be out of your sight, he ought not to be
far from you.</p>

<div class="pageheader">DOG SHOWING HIMSELF.</div>

<p id="para_514">514. You may, for a moment, think that what is here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
recommended contradicts the axiom laid down in <a href="#para_359">359</a>;
but it is there said, that nothing ought to make a dog
&#8220;<i>voluntarily</i>&#8221; leave his point. Indeed, the possession
of this accomplishment, so far from being productive
of any harm, greatly awakens a dog&#8217;s intelligence, and
makes him perceive, more clearly than ever, that the
sole object for which he is taken to the field is to obtain
shots for the gun that accompanies him. When he is
pointing on your side of a thick hedge, it will make him
understand why you call him off;&mdash;take him down wind,
and direct him to jump the fence: he will at once go to
the bird, and, on your encouraging him, force it to rise
on your side.</p>

<p id="para_515">515. You will practise this lesson, however, with great
caution, and not before his education is nearly completed,
lest he imagine that you do not wish him always to
remain stanch to his point. Indeed, if you are precipitate,
or injudicious, you may make him blink his game.</p>

<p id="para_516">516. After a little experience, he will very likely some
day satisfactorily prove his consciousness of your object,
by voluntarily coming out of thick cover to show you
where he is, and again going in and resuming his point.</p>

<p id="para_517"><span class="small">517. I was once shooting in Ireland with a friend &#40;Major <span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;e</span>&#41;,
late in the season, when we saw a very young pointer do this solely
from his own intelligence. Unperceived by either of us he had
broken fence, and was out of sight. In vain we whistled and called.
At length we saw him on the top of a bank &#40;in that country usually
miscalled &#8220;ditch&#8221;&#41;; but the moment he perceived that we noticed
him, down he jumped. We went up, and to our great satisfaction
found him steadily pointing a snipe. I need not say that he
received much praise and many caresses for the feat.</span></p>

<p id="para_518"><span class="small">518. I was partridge-shooting a few seasons back with an intimate
friend, who was anxious to give me a good day&#8217;s sport, when I
observed him beckoning to me from a distance. He told me, when
I came up to him, that some birds were immediately before him.
I was puzzled to conceive how he could know this, for his white
setter was alongside of him rolling on her back. He signalled to
her to go forward, and sure enough she marched on, straight as an
arrow&#8217;s flight, to a covey lying on the stubble. In answer to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
inquiries, my friend, who seemed to attach no value to the feat, but
to take it as a matter of course, told me that he had called the
bitch away from her point lest her presence should alarm the birds,
and make them take wing before I could come up.</span></p>

<p id="para_519"><span class="small">519. As my friend was obliged to return home early, he left the
lady with me. I had marked some partridges into the leeward side
of a large turnip-field. I could not get her to hunt where I wished;
I, therefore, no longer noticed her, but endeavoured to walk up the
birds without her assistance. After a time she rejoined me, and
ranged well and close. I then proceeded to beat the other part of
the field&mdash;the part she had already hunted contrary to my wishes.
Instead of making a cast to the right or left, on she went, directly
ahead, for nearly three hundred yards. I was remarking to my
attendant that she must be nearly useless to all but her master,
when I observed her come to a stiff point. I then felt convinced
that I had done her great injustice,&mdash;that she must have found
and left this covey, whilst I was hunting far to leeward,&mdash;and
that she had gone forward to resume her point, as soon as my face
was turned in the right direction. On my mentioning all this
to her owner, he said he had no doubt but that such was the case, as
she would often voluntarily leave game to look for him, and again
stand at it on perceiving that he watched her movements.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">POINT VOLUNTARILY RESUMED.</div>

<p id="para_520"><span class="small">520. An <i>old</i> Kentish acquaintance of mine, though he is still a
<i>young</i> man, has an Irish setter that behaved in a very similar
manner. <span class="glue">F&mdash;&mdash;r</span>, having severely wounded a hare in cover, put the
dog upon the scent. He immediately took it up, but &#8220;roaded&#8221;
so fast as to be soon out of sight. After a fruitless search for the
setter, <span class="glue">F&mdash;&mdash;r</span> was obliged to whistle two or three times, when he
showed himself at the end of a ride, and by his anxious looks and
motions seemed to invite his master to come on. This he did.
The sagacious beast, after turning two corners, at each of which he
stopped until <span class="glue">F&mdash;&mdash;r</span> came up, went into cover and resumed the
point, which my friend feels satisfied the dog must have left on
hearing the whistle, for the wounded hare, whose leg was broken,
was squatted within a yard of him. Such instances of a voluntary
relinquishment and resumption of a point, must lead us to think
that this accomplishment cannot be very difficult to teach dogs who
have been accustomed to the gratification of always seeing their
game carefully deposited in the bag.</span></p>

<p id="para_521"><span class="small">521. In a capital little treatise on field diversions, written by
a Suffolk sportsman upwards of seventy years ago, it is recorded
that a pointer bitch, belonging to a Doctor Bigsbye, used to give
tongue if she found in cover and was not perceived, and that she
would repeatedly bark to indicate her locality until she was relieved
from her point.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">TO RANGE WITHOUT GUN.</div>

<p class="center">TO HUNT REGULARLY FROM LEEWARD TO WINDWARD WITHOUT THE GUN.</p>

<p id="para_522">522. In paragraph <a href="#para_201">201</a> I observed, that when you
are obliged, as occasionally must be the case, to enter
a field to windward with your pupil, you ought to go
down to the leeward side of it, keeping him close to
your heels, before you commence to hunt. After
undeviatingly pursuing this plan for some time, you
can, before you come quite to the bottom of the field,
send him ahead &#40;by the underhand bowler&#8217;s swing of
the right hand, <span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_IV">iv</a>.</span> of 141&#41;, and, when he has reached
the bottom, signal to him to hunt to the right &#40;or left&#41;.
He will be so habituated to work under your eye &#40;<a href="#para_176">176</a>&#41;
that you will find it necessary to walk backwards &#40;up
the middle of the field&#41;, while instructing him. As he
becomes, by degrees, confirmed in this lesson, you can
sooner and sooner send him ahead &#40;from your heel&#41;,&mdash;but
increase the distances very gradually,&mdash;until at
length he will be so far perfected, that you may venture
to send him down wind to the extremity of the field
&#40;before he commences beating&#41;, while you remain quietly
at the top awaiting his return, until he shall have hunted
the whole ground, as systematically and carefully as if
you had accompanied him from the bottom. By this
method you will teach him, on his gaining more experience,
invariably to run to leeward, and hunt up to
windward &#40;crossing and re-crossing the wind&#41; whatever
part of a field you and he may enter. What a glorious
consummation! and it can be attained, but only by
great patience and perseverance. The least reflection,
however, will show you that you should not attempt it
until the dog is perfected in his range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p id="para_523">523. A careful dog, thus practised, will seldom spring
birds, however directly he may be running down wind.
He will pull up at the faintest indication of a scent,
being at all times anxiously on the look-out for the
coveted aroma.</p>

<p id="para_524">524. Not only to the idle or tired sportsman would it
be a great benefit to have a field thus beaten, but the
keenest and most indefatigable shot would experience
its advantages in the cold and windy weather customary
in November, when the tameness of partridge-shooting
cannot be much complained of; for the birds being then
ever ready to take wing, surely the best chance, by fair
means, of getting near them would be to intercept them
between the dog and yourself. The man&oelig;uvre much
resembles that recommended in <a href="#para_284">284</a>, but in this you
sooner and more directly head the birds.</p>

<div class="pageheader">HEAD RUNNING BIRDS.</div>

<p id="para_525">525. Here the consideration naturally arises, whether
dogs could not be <i>taught</i> &#40;when hunting in the ordinary
manner with the dog in rear&#41;</p>

<p class="center">TO HEAD RUNNING BIRDS.</p>

<p>Certainly it could be done. There have been many
instances of old dogs <i>spontaneously</i> galloping off, and
placing themselves on the other side of the covey &#40;which
they had pointed&#41; as soon as they perceived that it was
on the run,&mdash;and by good instruction you could develop,
or rather excite, that exercise of sagacity.</p>

<p id="para_526"><span class="small">526. Tolfrey &#40;formerly, I believe, of the 43rd&#41; gives, in his
&#8220;Sportsman in France,&#8221; so beautiful an instance of a dog&#8217;s untutored
intelligence, leading him to see the advantage of thus
placing running birds between himself and the gun, that I will
transcribe it, although I have already mentioned &#40;end of <a href="#para_206">206</a>&#41;
Grouse&#8217;s very similar behaviour.</span></p>

<p id="para_527"><span class="small">527. &#8220;On gaining some still higher ground, the dog drew and
stood. She was walked up to, but to my astonishment we found
no birds. She was encouraged, and with great difficulty coaxed off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
her point. She kept drawing on, but with the same ill-success. I
must confess I was for the moment sorely puzzled; but knowing
the excellence of the animal, I let her alone. She kept drawing on
for nearly a hundred yards&mdash;still no birds. At last, of her own
accord, and with a degree of instinct amounting almost to the faculty
of reasoning, she broke from her point, and dashing off to the right
made a <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, and was presently straight before me, some three
hundred yards off, setting the game whatever it might be, as much
as to say, &#8216;I&#8217;ll be ****** if you escape me this time.&#8217; We walked
steadily on, and when within about thirty yards of her, up got a
covey of red-legged partridges, and we had the good fortune to kill
a brace each. It is one of the characteristics of these birds to run
for an amazing distance before they take wing; but the sagacity of
my faithful dog baffled all their efforts to escape. We fell in with
several coveys of these birds during the day, and my dog ever after
gave them the double, and kept them between the gun and herself.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_528"><span class="small">528. Mr. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;i</span>, an officer high in the military store department,
wrote to me but last Christmas &#40;1863&#41; almost in the following
words:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">ALBERT AND PEGGY.</div>

<p id="para_529"><span class="small">529. &#8220;When stationed in Jamaica, quail and the wild guinea-fowl
were the only game I ever hunted for. The latter are very difficult
to approach, as they run for hours through the long grass and brushwood,
and will not rise unless hard pressed; but when once flushed,
they spread through the cover, and lie so close, that one may
almost kick them before without raising them. My dog, &#8216;Albert,&#8217;
was broke on grouse before I had him out from home. A steadier
or better dog you will rarely see. The first time we went out after
guinea-fowl he set to work as though hunting for grouse, pointing,
and roading cautiously when he came on the run of the birds, but,
from their pace through the cover, never coming up with them.
This occurred the first two or three mornings, and annoyed him
greatly. At last one day, as soon as he found that the birds were
running through the bush, he halted, turned round, and looked up
at me as much as to say: &#8216;My poking after these fellows is all
nonsense; do let me try some other dodge.&#8217; So I told him to go
on, when he instantly started off, making a wide cast until he
headed his game, when he commenced beating back towards me,
driving the birds before him until they were sufficiently near me,
when he dashed suddenly in amongst them, forcing the whole
pack to take wing. They spread through the surrounding grass
and cover, and &#8216;Albert&#8217; and his mother, &#8216;Peggy,&#8217; went to work,
picking up the birds singly or in pairs as they lay. Old mother
&#8216;Peggy&#8217; was far too sedate and stanch to follow her son in the
chase; she remained with me until he had brought back, and flushed
the birds, and then she vied with him in finding them.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">From this time I never had any difficulty in getting shots at these
wary birds, for the very moment they commenced running, &#8216;Albert&#8217;
was off until he headed them, drove them back, and flushed them,
as above described.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">When looking for quail, &#8216;Albert&#8217; behaved quite differently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
working steadily and cautiously, and never attempting to run into
or spring his game until I came close up to him.&#8221;</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SUWARROW.</div>

<p id="para_530"><span class="small">530. Grouse were unusually on the run one misty day, when the
able Judge mentioned in <a href="#para_490">490</a> was shooting over &#8220;Captain&#8217;s&#8221; companion,
&#8220;Suwarrow.&#8221; The dog &#8220;roaded&#8221; a pack for some time
very patiently, but suddenly darted off for a considerable distance
to the right and dropped into a long hag, through the mazes of
which Lord <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;f</span> followed as fast as the nature of the ground
would permit him. Every now and then the dog just raised his
head above the heather to satisfy himself that his Lordship was
coming. Where the hag ceased, and &#8220;Suwarrow&#8221; could no longer
conceal his movements, he commenced a very curious system of
tactics, travelling, after a most extraordinary fashion, <i>sideways</i>
on the arc of a circle, constantly keeping his stern towards its
centre. At length he wheeled about, and stood stock-still at a fixed
point, as if inviting Lord <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;f</span> to approach. He did so,&mdash;raised
a large pack, and had a capital right and left.</span></p>

<p id="para_531"><span class="small">531. It would appear that the &#8220;Marshal&#8221; soon perceived that
he had no chance of being enabled by a regular pursuit to bring his
artillery to bear upon the retreating party; he, therefore, resorted
to a novel strategy to lull them into fancied security, and induce
them to halt. He at once made a feint of abandoning the pursuit,
and moved off to the flank. He made a forced <i>concealed</i> march in
the hag; and when it would no longer mask his plans and he was
compelled to show himself, he merely let them see his <i>rear</i> guard,
that they might still think he was retiring, and did not show any
front until he had fairly entangled them between himself and his
guns. It was a feat worthy of &#8220;Wellington&#8221; or &#8220;Napoleon,&#8221; let
alone &#8220;Suwarrow.&#8221; By-the-bye, it explains why Lord <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;d&#8217;s</span>
dog &#40;<a href="#para_295">295</a>&#41; faced about whenever he perceived that his presence
alarmed the birds.</span></p>

<p id="para_532">532. If &#8220;Grouse&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_206">206</a>&#41;, Tolfrey&#8217;s bitch, &#8220;Albert,&#8221;
and &#8220;Suwarrow&#8221; had been taught to &#8220;hunt from leeward
to windward without the gun&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_522">522</a>&#41;, they would
have been habituated to seeing game intercepted between
themselves and their masters,&mdash;and then their spontaneously
heading running birds &#40;though undeniably
evincing great intelligence&#41; would not have been so very
remarkable. They would but have reversed matters
by placing themselves to windward of the birds while
the gun was to leeward. This shows that the acquisition
of that accomplishment &#40;<a href="#para_522">522</a>&#41; would be a great step
towards securing a knowledge of the one we are now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
considering. Indeed, there seems to be a mutual relation
between these two refinements in education, for the possession
of either would greatly conduce to the attainment
of the other.</p>

<div class="pageheader">HEADING WOUNDED BIRDS.</div>

<p id="para_533">533. This accomplishment&mdash;and hardly any can be
considered more useful&mdash;is not so difficult to teach an
intelligent dog as one might at first imagine; it is but
to lift him, and make him act on a larger scale, much in
the manner described in <a href="#para_309">309</a> and <a href="#para_544">544</a>. Like, however,
everything else in canine education&mdash;indeed, in all
education&mdash;it must be effected gradually; nor should
it be commenced before the dog has had a season&#8217;s
steadying; then practise him in heading every wounded
bird, and endeavour to make him do so at increased
distances. Whenever, also, he comes upon the &#8220;heel&#8221;
of a covey which is to leeward of him,&mdash;instead of
letting him &#8220;foot&#8221; it,&mdash;oblige him to quit the scent and
take a circuit &#40;sinking the wind&#41;, so as to place himself
to leeward of the birds. He will thereby <i>head the covey</i>,
and you will have every reason to hope that after a time
his own observation and intellect will show him the
advantage of thus intercepting birds and stopping them
when they are on the run, whether the man&oelig;uvre places
him to leeward or to windward of them.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<div class="pageheader">SETTER TO RETRIEVE.</div>

<p id="para_534">534. If you could succeed in teaching but one of
your dogs thus to take a wide sweep when he is ordered,
and head a running covey before it gets to the extremity
of the field &#40;while the other dogs remain near you&#41;, you
would be amply rewarded for months of extra trouble in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
training, by obtaining shots on days when good sportsmen,
with fair average dogs, would hardly pull a trigger.
And why should you not? Success would be next to
certain, if you could as readily place your dog exactly
where you wish, as shepherds do their collies &#40;<a href="#para_143">143</a>&#41;.
And whose fault will it be if you cannot? Clearly not
your dog&#8217;s, for he is as capable of receiving instruction
as the shepherd&#8217;s.</p>

<p id="para_535">535. Manifestly it would be worth while to take
great pains to teach this accomplishment, for in all
countries it would prove a most killing one when birds
become wild; and, as Tolfrey shows &#40;<a href="#para_529">529</a>&#41;, it would be
found particularly useful wherever the red-legged partridge
abounds,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>&mdash;which birds you will find do not lie
badly when the coveys are, by any means, well headed
and completely broken. But there are other accomplishments
nearly as useful as those already detailed;
the description of them, however, we will reserve for a
separate Chapter.</p>

<p class="center">SETTER TO RETRIEVE.</p>

<p id="para_536">536. Undeniably there is some value in the extra
number of shots obtained by means of highly broken
dogs; and nearly as undeniable is it that no man, who
is not over-rich, will term that teaching superfluous
which enables him to secure in one dog the services of
two. Now, I take it for granted &#40;as I cannot suppose
you are willing to lose many head of killed game&#41;, that
you would be glad to be always accompanied in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
field by a dog that retrieves. Unless you have such
a companion, there will be but little chance of your
often securing a slightly winged bird in turnips. Indeed,
in all rough shooting, the services of a dog so
trained are desirable to prevent many an unfortunate
hare and rabbit from getting away to die a painful, lingering
death; and yet, if the possession of a large kennel is
ever likely to prove half as inconvenient to you as it
would to me, you would do well, according to my idea
of the matter, to dispense with a regular retriever,
provided you have a highly broken setter who retrieves
well.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SETTER PREFERRED TO POINTER.</div>

<p id="para_537">537. I say setter rather than pointer, not on account
of his more affectionate, and perhaps more docile disposition
&#40;for certainly he is less liable to sulk under
punishment&#41;, but because, thanks to his long coat, he
will be able to work in any cover, and that from nature
he &#8220;roads&#8221; quicker.</p>

<p><span class="small">I must, however, plead <i>guilty</i> &#40;for many good sportsmen will
think I evince bad taste&#41; to a predilection for setters&mdash;meaning
always <i>cautious</i> setters&mdash;a partiality, perhaps, attributable to
having shot more over wild, uncertain ground than in well-stocked
preserves. Doubtless, in a very enclosed country, where game is
abundant, pointers are preferable, far preferable, more especially
should there be a scarcity of water; but for severe and fast work,
and as a servant of all work, there is nothing, I humbly conceive,
like the setter.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He may be, and generally is, the more difficult to
break; but when success has crowned your efforts, what a noble,
enduring, sociable, attached animal you possess. I greatly, too,
admire his long, stealthy, blood-like action,&mdash;&#40;for I am not speaking
of the large heavy sort before which in old days whole coveys used
to be nettled&#41;, and the animated waving of his stern, so strongly
indicative of high breeding; though, strange to say, in gracefulness
of carriage the fox, when hunting, and actually on game, far excels
him. But we are again getting astray beyond our proper limits;
let us keep to the subject of dog-breaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<div class="pageheader">TO RETRIEVE SECOND SEASON.</div>

<p id="para_538">538. As it will be your endeavour, during your pupil&#8217;s
first season, to make him thoroughly stanch and steady,
I cannot advise you &#40;as a general rule liable, of course,
to many exceptions&mdash;one of which is named in <a href="#para_317">317</a>&#41;, to
let him retrieve,&mdash;by retrieve I always mean fetch,&mdash;until
the following year. There is another advantage
in the delay. His sagacity will have shown him that
the design of every shot is to bag the game&mdash;when,
therefore, he has once been permitted to pick up a bird,
he will be desirous of carrying it immediately to you,
and will resist the temptation to loiter with it, mouthing
and spoiling it; and however keenly he may have
heretofore &#8220;sought dead,&#8221; he will henceforth search with
redoubled zeal, from the delight he will experience in
being permitted to carry his game. Moreover, the
season&#8217;s shooting, without lifting, will have so thoroughly
confirmed him in the &#8220;down charge,&#8221; that the
increased<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> inclination to bolt off in search of a falling
bird will be successfully resisted. If he has been taught
while young to &#8220;fetch&#8221; &#40;<a href="#para_107">107</a>, <a href="#para_109">109</a>, &amp;c.&#41;, he will be so
anxious to take the birds to you, that instead of there
being any difficulty in teaching him this accomplishment,
you will often, during his first season, have to
restrain him from lifting when he is &#8220;pointing dead.&#8221;
The least encouragement will make him gladly pick up
the birds, and give them, as he ought, to no one but
yourself.</p>

<p id="para_539"><span class="small">539. Suppose you possess no regular retriever&mdash;if, instead of
lifting your game yourself, you accustom one of your pointers or
setters to do so, you will occasionally, in some odd manner, bag a
bird which you would otherwise inevitably lose. In <a href="#para_97">97</a> is given
such an instance; and in Scotland, no later than last season, I saw
another. An outlying cock-pheasant rose out of stubble. It was a
long shot, but he was knocked over, falling into an adjoining piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of turnips. After the &#8220;down charge,&#8221; a pointer bitch accustomed
to retrieve, was sent to fetch him. The moment she approached
the bird, up he got, apparently as strong as ever, and flew over some
rising ground, but wither, I had no idea, further than suspecting
that he was making for a distant cover on <i>forbidden</i> ground. I,
therefore, at once gave him up as lost. The dog, however, was
more sanguine, for, to my great surprise, off she started in pursuit,
clearly imagining it was quite a mistake of the pheasant&#8217;s. I soon
lost sight of her, but, to my great gratification, I observed her, some
little time afterwards, topping the hillock with the bird in her
mouth. If she had been young, her chase after the pheasant might
only have shown sad unsteadiness and wildness; but as she was
a stanch sober old lady, it manifestly evinced nothing but,&mdash;it
will be safest to say,&mdash;much intelligence and discrimination, lest
<i>you</i> cavil at the words reason or reflection. I must own <i>I</i> should
not.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="pageheader">ONLY ONE TO RETRIEVE</div>

<p id="para_540">540. You need hardly be cautioned not to let more
than one dog retrieve the same bird. With more dogs
than one the bird would, almost to a certainty, be torn:
and if a dog once becomes sensible of the enjoyment he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
would derive in pulling out the feathers of a bird, you
will find it difficult to make him deliver it up before he
has in some way disfigured it.</p>

<p><span class="small">A bitch that retrieved admirably, known to an acquaintance of
mine, was on one occasion so annoyed at being interfered with by
her companion, that, in a fit of jealousy, she actually bolted the
partridge she was carrying lest &#8220;Jack&#8221; should come in for a nibble.
I must confess I think it of much importance that a dog who
retrieves should be tender-mouthed, for I own I like to put my
birds by smooth and tidy, and, if I want them to keep long, take
care to observe the old rule of hanging them &#40;by their heads rather
than their feet, that rain may not saturate the feathers&#41; on the loops
outside the game-bag until they are quite cool, before I allow them
to become inside passengers; but I generally have their bodies
placed within the netting, as for want of this precaution many a bird
has been decapitated in the scramble through a thick hedge. Game,
whether cool or warm, kept in a close <i>Mackintosh</i> bag, soon becomes
unfit to send to any distance.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">THE FINDER TO RETRIEVE</div>

<p id="para_541">541. If you shoot with several dogs that retrieve, be
careful always to let the dog who finds the game be
the one to bring it. It is but fair that he should be so
rewarded, and thus all will be stimulated to hunt with
increased diligence.</p>

<p id="para_542"><span class="small">542. Captain <span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, R.N., of Little <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;w</span>, Essex &#40;well-known
for the gallantry and skill he displayed when risking his own life to
save that of many stranded on the Kentish coast&#41;, used to break in
his own dogs, and retrieved them to show yet greater obedience and
forbearance while retrieving. At one period he was in the habit of
taking two pointers and a little spaniel into the field to hunt
together,&mdash;the latter so small that he often carried it in his pocket
when it was fatigued. The following kind of scene constantly
occurred. One of the pointers would stand,&mdash;the other back,&mdash;so
also would the spaniel. Captain <span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, after killing his bird and
loading, probably said, &#8220;Don, go fetch it.&#8221; Don went forward to
obey. &#8220;Stop Don.&#8221; Don halted. &#8220;Carlo, fetch the bird.&#8221; Carlo
advanced. &#8220;Stop, Carlo.&#8221; Carlo obeyed. &#8220;Tiny, bring it.&#8221; The
little creature did as ordered, and placed it in her master&#8217;s hand, the
pointers meanwhile never moving.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SCENT OF HIT AND MISSED BIRDS.</div>

<p id="para_543"><span class="small">543. I am not urging you to give up the time requisite to educate
dogs so highly as this, but you see it can be done.</span></p>

<p id="para_544">544. If the dog that found the covey be not able
to wind the bird you have shot, make one of the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
dogs take a large circuit. The latter may thus, without
interfering with the first dog, come upon the bird, should
it have run far. Send him in the direction the covey
has taken&mdash;the chances are great the bird is travelling
towards the same point. By pursuing this plan,
obviously there will be much less chance of your losing
a bird than if you allow the dogs to keep close together
while searching. &#40;See also <a href="#para_115">115</a>.&#41;</p>

<p id="para_545">545. Do not think that by making your setter lift
&#40;after his first season&#41;, instead of &#8220;pointing dead,&#8221; there
will be any increased risk of his raising unsprung birds.
The difference between the scent of dead or wounded
game, and that of game perfectly uninjured, is so great
that no steady, experienced dog will fail to point any
fresh bird he may come across whilst seeking for that
which is lost.</p>

<p><span class="small">As a proof of this I may mention that,</span></p>
<p id="para_546">546<span class="small">. In North America I once saw three snipe lying on the ground,
which a pointer, that retrieved, had regularly set one after the
other, having found a couple on his way to retrieve the first, and
which he afterwards brought in succession to his master, who had
all the time governed the dog entirely by signs, never having been
obliged to use his voice beyond saying in a low tone, &#8220;Dead,&#8221; or
&#8220;Find.&#8221; I remember, also, hearing of a retrieving setter that on
one occasion pointed a fresh bird, still retaining in her mouth the
winged partridge which she was carrying,&mdash;and of a pointer who
did the same when he was bringing a hare; there must, too, be
few sportsmen who will not admit that they have found it more
difficult to make a dog give up the pursuit of a wounded hare than
of one perfectly uninjured. I know of a sportsman&#8217;s saying he felt
certain that the hare his retriever was <i>coursing</i> over the moors must
have been struck, although the only person who had fired stoutly
maintained that the shot was a regular miss. The owner of the
dog, however, averred that this was impossible, as he never could
get the discerning animal to follow any kind of unwounded game;
and, on the other hand, that no rating would make him quit the
pursuit of <i>injured</i> running feather or fur. The retriever&#8217;s speedy
return with puss, conveniently balanced between his jaws, bore
satisfactory testimony to the accuracy of both his own and his master&#8217;s
judgement. In December &#8217;49, a woodcock that was struck hard
took a long flight. A setter bitch I have often shot over came,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
quite unexpectedly to herself, on the scent of the bird when it was
at such a distance from her that the party who had shot it felt sure
she was on other game. Instead, however, of &#8220;setting,&#8221; the bitch,
who, be it observed, is particularly steady, drew on, and after
deliberately walking up to the woodcock, gave it a touseling, for
she is not broken into &#8220;pointing dead.&#8221; It is certain that her
olfactory nerves plainly told her there was no chance of its rising.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">COLONEL <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;Y&#8217;S</span> VENUS.</div>

<p id="para_547"><span class="small">547. In corroboration of the correctness of the opinion I have
just expressed, respecting the difference between the scent of injured
and uninjured birds, I am glad to be permitted to make the following
extract from a letter I lately received from Colonel <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;y</span>, spoken
of in <a href="#para_99">99</a>. He writes, &#8220;When shooting at Alresford, in Essex, last
year, I had a singular instance of Venus&#8217; sagacity in detecting the
scent of wounded game. I was returning home, and while walking
through a field of turnips a covey of birds got up near the fence. I
winged one, which fell in the midst of some rabbits and pheasants
feeding near the edge of the cover on the opposite side. Of course,
they all bolted at the appearance of such an unwelcome visitor as
the retriever&mdash;the rabbits into their burrows,&mdash;the pheasants into
cover. My servant brought the bitch up to the place where I
thought the bird had fallen. After puzzling about for some time,
she took the trail about thirty yards down by the side of the fence,
and then &#8216;set&#8217; at a rabbit-hole. Thinking she was mistaken, I
rated her and tried to get her away, but she stuck to her point.
Determining, therefore, to ascertain the facts, we dug up the top
part of a narrow fence, and bolted a couple of rabbits out of the
hole, at the further end of which we found my wounded bird, an old
Frenchman.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="pageheader">HARMONY BETWEEN DOG AND MASTER.</div>

<p id="para_548">548. Some good sportsmen maintain that a retrieving
setter &#40;or pointer&#41; on finding a dead bird ought to point
it until directed to lift it. This training they hold to be
advisable, on the ground that it conduces to the dog&#8217;s
steadiness by diminishing his wish to run forward on
seeing a bird fall; but the plan has necessarily this evil
consequence, that should the setter, when searching for
the dead bird, come across and point, <i>as he ought</i>, any
fresh game, on your telling him to fetch it &#40;as you
naturally will&#41;, he must spring it if he attempt to obey
you. Surely this would tend more to unsteady him
than the habit of lifting his dead birds as soon as found?
Your dog and you ought always to work in the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
harmony&mdash;in the mutual confidence of your, at all times,
thoroughly understanding each other&mdash;and you should
carefully avoid the possibility of ever perplexing him by
giving him any order it is out of his power to obey,
however much he may exert himself. Moreover, if you
teach your retrieving setter to &#8220;point dead,&#8221; you at once
relinquish&mdash;surely unnecessarily?&mdash;all hope of ever witnessing
such a fine display of sagacity and steadiness as
has just been related in the first part of <a href="#para_546">546</a>.</p>

<p id="para_549">549. If you object to a setter&#8217;s being taught to lift on
the ground, that it will make the other dogs jealous,
pray remember that the argument has equal force against
the employment of a regular retriever in their presence.</p>

<p class="center">REGULAR RETRIEVER TO BEAT.</p>

<p id="para_550">550. We all have our prejudices,&mdash;every Englishman
has a right to many. One of mine is to think a <i>regular</i>
retriever positively not worth his keep to you for general
shooting <i>if one of your setting dogs will retrieve well</i>&mdash;but
what an all-important &#8220;if&#8221; is this! However, if you shoot
much in cover, I admit that a regular retriever which can
be worked in perfect silence, never refusing to come in
when he is merely signalled to, or, if out of sight, softly
whistled to, is better<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> &#40;particularly when you employ
beaters&#41;, but even then he need not be the idler that
one generally sees,&mdash;he might be broken in to hunt
close to you, and give you the same service as a mute
spaniel. I grant this is somewhat difficult to accomplish,
for it much tends to unsteady him, but it can be effected,&mdash;I
have seen it,&mdash;and being practicable, it is at least
worth trying; for if you succeed, you, as before &#40;<a href="#para_536">536</a>&#41;,
make one dog perform the work of two; and, besides its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
evident advantage in thick cover, if he accompany you
in your everyday shooting, you will thus obtain, in the
course of a season, many a shot which your other dogs,
especially in hot weather, would pass over. If, too, the
retriever hunts quite close to you, he can in no way
annoy his companions, or interfere with them, for I take
it for granted he will be so obedient as to come to
&#8220;heel&#8221; the instant he gets your signal.</p>

<div class="pageheader">RETRIEVERS BEATING.</div>

<p id="para_551"><span class="small">551. Many regular retrievers take spontaneously to beating. Two
brothers, named <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, living at Grewell, in Hampshire, termed
by the village wags, not inappropriately, &#8220;Watergruel&#8221; &#40;there is
good snipe and duck-shooting in the surrounding marshes&#41;, have a
ranging-retriever &#40;a Newfoundland&#41;, still young, now called &#8220;Nelly,&#8221;
though, as a puppy, christened &#8220;Nelson&#8221; by the girls of the family.
<i>Miss</i> Nelly, as if to give further proof of the impropriety of her
original name, is remarkably timid, and therefore has been allowed
to follow, unchecked, her own devices in the field. In imitation of
her companions, she took to beating and pointing; and, after the
&#8220;down charge,&#8221; would retrieve as zealously and efficiently as if she
had never been allowed to &#8220;quit heel,&#8221; except for that express
purpose. I have myself, when in the north, killed game to the
voluntary point of &#8220;Sambo,&#8221; a black regular retriever, who was
permitted to range close to the keeper. I have also shot to the
point of &#8220;Bang,&#8221; a very handsome animal, a cross between a Newfoundland
and a setter. Dogs so bred often, when ranging, take to
pointing for a short period before dashing in; or can easily be made
to do so,&mdash;thereby giving the gun a very acceptable caution.</span></p>

<p id="para_552"><span class="small">552. The sire of &#8220;Venus&#8221;&mdash;honourable mention is made of her
in <a href="#para_99">99</a>&mdash;a very celebrated dog, had an invaluable quality as a retriever,
though the very opposite of the range I have been recommending.
He disturbed as little ground as possible during his search, and <i>no
fresh ground returning</i>. After running with the greatest correctness
a wounded pheasant through a large cover, he would invariably
return upon the same track he had taken when first sent from
&#8220;heel.&#8221; I confess I cannot see how this admirable habit could be
taught by any one but Dame Nature. Is it not a beautiful instance
of sagacity? But you will observe that, singularly good as was this
regular retriever, he would have sprung the snipe at which the
retrieving-pointer stood &#40;<a href="#para_546">546</a>&#41;. For instructions regarding regular

<p id="para_553">553. This a knowing old dog will often do of his own
accord; but you must not attempt to teach a young one
this useful habit, until you are satisfied that there is
no risk of making him blink his birds. You can then
call him off when he is swimming towards dead birds,
and signal to him to follow those that are fluttering
away. If the water is not too deep, rush in yourself,
and set him a good example by actively pursuing the
runaways; and until all the cripples that can be recovered<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
are safely bagged, do not let him lift one of
those killed outright. If very intelligent, he will before
long perceive the advantage of the system, or at least
find it the more exciting method, and adhere to it without
obliging you to continue your aquatic excursions.
&#40;For advice about water retrievers, see <a href="#para_90">90</a> to <a href="#para_95">95</a>.&#41; I
have placed this paragraph among the &#8220;refinements&#8221; in
breaking; but I ought, perhaps, to have entered it
sooner; for if you are fond of duck-shooting, and live
in a neighbourhood where you have good opportunities
of following it, you should regard this accomplishment
as a necessary part of your spaniel&#8217;s education.</p>

<div class="pageheader">SUPERFLUOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</div>

<p id="para_554">554. In your part of the country none of these extra,
or, as some will say, always superfluous accomplishments
may be required; but if you consider that a pupil of
yours attaining any one of them would be serviceable,
be not deterred from teaching it by the idea that you
would be undertaking a difficult task. Any one of
them, I was nearly saying all of them, could be taught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
a dog with far greater ease, and in a shorter time, than
a well-established, judicious range.</p>

<p id="para_555">555. It would be quite unreasonable to expect a
regular breaker &#40;&#8220;mark,&#8221; I do not say your gamekeeper&#41;
to teach your dog any of these accomplishments. He
may be fully aware of the judiciousness of the system,
and be sensible of its great advantages, but the many
imperious calls upon his time would preclude his pursuing
it in all its details. At the usual present prices
it would not pay him to break in dogs so highly.</p>

The Conclusion.</p>

<p id="para_556"><span class="small">556. We have come to the concluding division &#40;dignified by the
name of Chapter&#41; of this little Work; for I have at length nearly
finished my prosing about dog-breaking. But reflect upon what I
have said. The more you do, the more, I think, you will be of
opinion that I have recommended only what is reasonable, and that
but little attention beyond the trouble usually bestowed, <i>if directed
by good judgment</i>, is required to give a dog the education which
I have described.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">BECKFORD&mdash;BUCKHOUND.</div>

<p id="para_557"><span class="small">557. I wish I could animate you with but a quarter of the
enthusiasm which I once felt on the subject. I am not desirous of
making you dissatisfied with anything that you possess, excepting
your dogs, such as, I fear, they most probably are, and that only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
because, if they are young, a little judicious extra-exertion on your
part will add as much to their usefulness as to your own enjoyment.
And I do not wish them, or anything you have, or have not, to
make you discontented; I only pray you not to be supine. If you
can get no more alluring drink than cold water, reflect on its wholesomeness,
and enjoy it, if you can, with all the relish of a parched
Arab; but I entreat you not to be contented with a disorderly
<i>noise-exciting</i> cur, when a trifling addition to your pains will ensure
you an obedient, well-trained animal,&mdash;one that will procure you
twice as many shots as the other. It will, indeed. Believe me, I
am not too extravagant in my conception of a perfect dog. You
may not consider it worth your while to take the trouble of giving
him such an education; but it seems hardly reasonable to say it
could not be imparted. Naturally enough you may distrust my
judgment, but you cannot doubt the experience of the reflecting,
discriminating Beckford; and what does he say on the subject of
canine education?</span></p>

<p id="para_558"><span class="small">558. &#8220;The many learned dogs and learned horses that so frequently
appear and astonish the vulgar, sufficiently evince what
education is capable of; and it is to education I must attribute the
superior excellence of the buckhound, since I have seen high-bred
fox-hounds do the same under the same good masters.</span></p>

<p id="para_559"><span class="small">559. &#8220;Dogs that are constantly with their masters acquire a
wonderful degree of penetration, and much may be done through
the medium of their affections. I attribute the extraordinary
sagacity of the buckhound to the manner in which he is treated.
He is the constant companion of his instructor and benefactor&mdash;the
man whom he was first taught to fear he has since learned to love.
Can we wonder that he should be obedient to him? Oft have we
viewed with surprise the hounds and deer amusing themselves
familiarly together on the same lawn,&mdash;living, as it were, in the
most friendly intercourse; and with no less surprise have we heard
the keeper give the word, when instantly the very nature of the dog
seemed changed; roused from his peaceful state, he is urged on
with a relentless fury, which only death can satisfy&mdash;the death of
the <i>very</i> deer he is encouraged to pursue. The business of the day
over, see him follow, careless and contented, his master&#8217;s steps, to
repose on the same lawn where the frightened deer again return,
and are again indebted to <i>his</i> courtesy for their wonted pasture.
Wonderful proofs of obedience, sagacity, and penetration!&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_560"><span class="small">560. If you have at hand St. John&#8217;s &#8220;Tour in Sutherlandshire&#8221;
&#40;he is the author of that most interesting work, &#8220;Wild Sports and
Natural History of the Highlands&#8221;&#41;, pray turn to the part in the
second volume, where he describes the old show-woman&#8217;s learned
dog. I would transcribe the whole of the amusing account, were
not this little book already swollen to undue proportions&mdash;but I
must quote the concluding observations, as his opinion respecting
the aptitude of dogs for instruction so fully coincides with Beckford&#8217;s.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">SHOW-WOMAN&#8217;S DOG.</div>

<p id="para_561"><span class="small">561. &#8220;The tricks consisted of the usual routine of adding up
figures, spelling short words, and finding the first letter of any town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
named by one of the company. The last trick was very cleverly
done, and puzzled us very much, as we&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the grown-up part of
the audience&mdash;were most intently watching not him but his mistress,
in order to discover what signs she made to guide him in his choice
of the cards; but we could not perceive that she moved hand or
foot, or made any signal whatever. Indeed, the dog seemed to pay
but little regard to her, but to receive his orders direct from any one
who gave them. In fact, his teaching must have been perfect, and
his intellect wonderful. Now I dare say I shall be laughed at for
introducing an anecdote of a learned dog, and told that it was &#8216;all
trick.&#8217; No doubt it was &#8216;all trick,&#8217; but it was a very clever one, and
showed how capable of education dogs are&mdash;far more so than we
imagine. For here was a dog performing tricks so cleverly that not
one out of four or five persons, who were most attentively watching,
could find out how he was assisted by his mistress.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_562">562. In following Beckford&#8217;s advice respecting your
making, as far as is practicable, your dog your &#8220;constant
companion,&#8221; do not, however, forget that you require him
to evince great diligence and perseverance in the field;
and, therefore, that his highest enjoyment must consist
in being allowed to hunt.</p>

<div class="pageheader">LIBERTIES PERMITTED.</div>

<p id="para_563">563. Now, it seems to be a principle of nature,&mdash;of
canine as well as human nature,&mdash;to feel, through
life, most attachment to that pursuit, whatever it may
be, which is most followed in youth. If a dog is permitted
as a youngster to have the run of the kitchen,
he will be too fond of it when grown up. If he is
allowed to amuse himself in every way his fancy dictates,
he will think little of the privilege of hunting.
Therefore, the hours he cannot pass with you &#40;after you
have commenced his education&#41;, I am sorry to say it,
but I must do so, he ought to be in his <i>kennel</i>&mdash;loose in
his kennel,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> not tied up; for straining at his collar
would throw out his elbows, and so make him grow up
bandy-legged. If, however, he must be fastened, let it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
be by a chain. He would soon learn to gnaw through
a cord, especially if a young puppy, who, from nature,
is constantly using his teeth, and thus acquire a trick
that some day might prove very inconvenient were no
chain at hand. You would greatly consult his comfort
by having the chain attached, with a loose ring and
swivel, to a spike fixed a few paces in front of his
kennel, so that he could take some exercise by trotting
round and round.</p>

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;SELF-HUNTING.&#8221;</div>

<p id="para_564">564. When your dog has attained some age, and
hunting has become with him a regular passion, I believe
you may give him as much liberty as you please
without diminishing his zeal,&mdash;but most carefully prevent
his ever hunting alone, technically called &#8220;self-hunting.&#8221;
At that advanced time of life, too, a few occasional
irregularities in the field may be innocuously permitted.
The steadiest dogs will, at times, deviate from the usual
routine of their business, sagaciously thinking that such
departure from rule must be acceptable if it tends to
obtain the game; and it will be advisable to leave an
experienced dog to himself whenever he evinces great
perseverance in spontaneously following some unusual
plan. You may have seen an old fellow, instead of
cautiously &#8220;roading&#8221; and &#8220;pointing dead,&#8221; rush forward
and seize an unfortunate winged bird, while it was
making the best use of its legs after the flight of the
rest of the covey&mdash;some peculiarity in the scent emitted
having probably betrayed to the dog&#8217;s <i>practised</i> nose
that the bird was injured. When your pup arrives at
such years of discrimination, you need not so rigorously
insist upon a patient &#8220;down charge,&#8221; should you see a
winged cock-pheasant running into cover. Your dog&#8217;s
habits of discipline would be, I should hope, too well
confirmed by his previous course of long drill for such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
temporary departure from rule to effect any permanent
mischief; but, oh! beware of any such laxity with a
<i>young</i> pupil, however strongly you may be tempted. In
five minutes you may wholly undo the labour of a
month. On days, therefore, when you are anxious,
<i>co&ucirc;te qui co&ucirc;te</i>, to fill the game-bag, pray leave him at
home. Let him acquire any bad habit when you are
thus pressed for birds, and you will have more difficulty
in eradicating it than you would have in teaching him
almost any accomplishment. This reason made me all
along keep steadily in view the supposition, that you
had commenced with a dog unvitiated by evil associates,
either biped or quadruped; for assuredly you would find
it far easier to give a thoroughly good education to
such a pupil, than to complete the tuition &#40;particularly
in his range&#41; of one usually considered broken, and who
must, in the natural order of things, have acquired some
habits more or less opposed to your own system. If, as
a puppy, he had been allowed to self-hunt and chase,
your labour would be herculean. And inevitably this
would have been your task, had you ever allowed him
to associate with any dog who &#8220;self-hunted.&#8221; The
oldest friend in your kennel might be led astray by
forming an intimacy with the veriest cur, if a &#8220;self-hunter.&#8221;
There is a fascination in the vice&mdash;above all,
in killing young hares and rabbits,&mdash;that the steadiest
dog cannot resist when he has been persuaded to join in
the sport by some vagabond of a poacher possessing a
tolerable nose, rendered keenly discerning by experience.</p>

<p id="para_565">565. I hope that by this time we too well understand
each other for you now to wonder why I think that you
should not commence hunting your young dog where
game is abundant. Professional breakers prefer such
ground, because, from getting plenty of points, it enables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
them to train their dogs more quickly, and <i>sufficiently
well</i> to ensure an early sale. This is <i>their</i> object, and
they succeed. <i>My</i> object is that you shall establish
<i>ultimately</i> great perseverance and a fine range in your
young dog, let birds be ever so scarce. If you show him
too many at first, he will subsequently become easily
dispirited whenever he fails in getting a point.</p>

<div class="pageheader">ENERGY OF IRISH DOGS.</div>

<p><span class="small">It is the general paucity of game in Ireland &#40;snipe and woodcock
excepted&#41; that makes dogs trained in that country show so much
untiring energy and indomitable zeal when hunted on our side of
the Channel. But the slight wiry Irish red setter &#40;whom it is so
difficult to see on the moor from his colour&#41;, is naturally a dog
of great pace and endurance. There is, however, a much heavier
sort.</span></p>

<p id="para_566"><span class="small">566. Many dogs, solely from want of good condition, greatly
disappoint their masters at the beginning of the season. You could
not expect your hunter to undergo a hard day&#8217;s work without a
previous course of tolerably severe exercise; and why expect it of
your dog? A couple of hours&#8217; quiet exercise in the cool of the
morning or evening will not harden his feet, and get him into the
wind and condition requisite for the performance you may desire of
him some broiling day in the middle of August or early in September.
If you do not like to disturb your game, and have no convenient
country to hunt over, why should you not give him some gallops
before the beginning of the shooting-season, when you are mounted
on your trotting hackney? Think how greyhounds are by degrees
brought into wind and hard meat before coursing commences.
Such work on the road will greatly benefit his feet,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> particularly if,
on his return home in wet weather, they are bathed with a strong
solution of salt and water. When the ground is hard and dry, they
should be washed with warm water and soap, both to soothe them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and to remove all dust and gravel. They might afterwards be
gradually hardened by applying the salt and water. When they
are inflamed and bruised, almost a magical cure might be effected
by their being sponged with a solution of arnica&mdash;ten parts of water
to one of arnica. Should the dog lick the lotion, dissolve a little
aloes in it. If, by-the-bye, you would make it a rule personally to
ascertain that attention is always paid to your dogs after a hard
day&#8217;s work, and not leave them to the tender mercies of an uninterested
servant, you would soon be amply repaid for your trouble
by their additional performance. Many men make it a rule to send
their dogs to the mountains a week or two before the grouse-shooting;
but they seldom even then get sufficiently exercised, and their
mettle is slacked &#40;confessedly a temporary advantage with half broken,
<i>wild</i> dogs&#41;, instead of being increased, by finding that,
however many points they may make &#40;at squeakers under their
nose&#41;, they never secure a bird. A month&#8217;s road-work, with
alterative medicine, is far better.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">MUSCLE WANTED, NOT FAT.</div>

<p id="para_567"><span class="small">567. Dogs severely worked should be fed abundantly on a nutritious
diet. Hunters and stage-coach horses have an unlimited
allowance, and the work of eager setters and pointers &#40;in a hilly
country particularly&#41; is proportionately hard; but the constitutions
of dogs vary so greatly that the quantity as well as quality of their
diet should be considered; for it must be your aim to obtain the
largest development of muscle with the least superfluity of flesh,&mdash;that
enemy to pace and endurance in dog as surely as in horse and man.
Yet this remark does not apply to a water retriever: he should have
fat. It is a warm, well-fitting great coat, more impervious to wet
than a <i>Mackintosh</i>,&mdash;furnished by Providence to whales, bears, and
all animals that have to contend with cold; and obviously your
patient companion will feel the benefit of one when he is shivering
alongside you while you are lying <i>perdu</i> in a bed of damp rushes.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<div class="pageheader">NOSE IN CONDITION.</div>

<p id="para_568"><span class="small">568. Having mentioned condition, I am led to observe, that in
America I saw a pointer, which, from being hunted, I may say
daily, Sundays excepted, could not be kept in condition on oatmeal
and greaves, but which was put in hard flesh, and did his work
admirably, when Indian-corn meal was substituted for the oatmeal.
I have not seen it used in this country, but I can fancy it to be a
heating food, better calculated for dogs at regular hard work than
when they are summering.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> It is well known that no food should
be given in a very hot state,&mdash;not of a higher temperature than
milk-warm; and that evening is the proper feeding-time, in order
that the dogs may sleep immediately afterwards, and not be full
when they are taken out for their morning&#8217;s work.</span></p>

<p id="para_569"><span class="small">569. In India, I remember complaining to an old sportsman that
I had much difficulty in keeping my dogs free from mange. He
at once asked if I did not give them beef-tea with their rice. I
acknowledged that I did. He said it was of too heating a nature.
I tried mutton-broth, agreeably to his recommendation. Every
vestige of mange vanished, but yet I could hardly believe it
attributable to so slight a change in their diet, for very little meat
was used. As the mutton was much dearer, I again tried the beef.
It would not do. The mange reappeared. I was, therefore, obliged
to return to the mutton, and continue it. The teeth of dogs show
that flesh is a natural diet; and if they are wholly deprived of it
when they are young, they will acquire most revolting habits,&mdash;feeding
upon any filth they may find, and often rolling in it. The
meat should be cooked.</span></p>

<p id="para_570">570. The good condition of a dog&#8217;s nose is far from
being an immaterial part of his conditioning, for on the
preservation of its sensitiveness chiefly depends your
hope of sport. If it be dry from being feverish, or if it
be habituated to the villanous smells of an impure
kennel, how are you to expect it to acknowledge the
faintest taint of game&mdash;yet one that, if followed up by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>olfactory nerves in high order, would lead to a sure find?
Sweetness of breath is a strong indication of health.
Cleanliness is as essential as a judicious diet; and you
may be assured, that if you look for excellence, you
must always have your youngster&#8217;s kennel clean, dry,
airy, and yet sufficiently warm. The more you attend
to this, the greater will be his bodily strength and the
finer his nose.</p>

<p><span class="small">In India the kennels are, of course, too hot; but in the best
constructed which fell under my observation, the heat was much
mitigated by the roofs being thickly thatched with grass. In
England, however, nearly all kennels&mdash;I am not speaking of those
for hounds&mdash;are far too cold in winter.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">KENNELS. WARMTH NECESSARY.</div>

<p id="para_571">571. There must be <i>sufficient</i> warmth. Observe how
a petted dog, especially after severe exercise, lays himself
down close to the fire, and enjoys it. Do you not see
that instinct teaches him to do this? and must it not be
of great service to him? Why, therefore, deny him in
cold weather, after a hard day&#8217;s work, a place on the
hearth-rug? It is the want of sufficient heat in the
kennels, and good drying and brushing after hard work,
that makes sporting dogs, particularly if they are long-coated
ones, suffer from rheumatism, blear eyes, and
many ills that generally, but not necessarily, attend
them in old age. The instance given in <a href="#para_226">226</a> is a proof
of this.</p>

<p><span class="small">Winter pups, you are told, are not so strong as those born in
summer. They would be, if they were reared in a warm room.
The mother&#8217;s bodily heat cannot warm them; for after a while, they
so pull her about and annoy her, that she either leaves them for a
time, or drives them from her.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">VACCINATION FOR DISTEMPER.</div>

<p id="para_572"><span class="small">572. As I have casually touched on puppies, I will take the
opportunity of recommending, according to the plan adopted by
some sportsmen, and of which I have experienced the advantage,
that you have a whole litter, soon after it has been weaned,
&#40;provided it be in a healthy state&#41;, inoculated for the distemper,&mdash;a
small feather, previously inserted in the nose of a diseased dog,
being for an instant put up the nostrils of the puppies. It will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
necessary to keep them unusually warm,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and feed them high,
while they are suffering from the effects of this treatment. It is
not likely that you will lose any; but if you should, the loss will be
small compared with that of an educated dog at a mature age. The
extent of the mischief will probably be a slight cough, with a little
running at the nose for a few days.</span></p>

<p id="para_573"><span class="small">573. Having heard that vaccination would greatly mitigate the
distressing symptoms of distemper, if not entirely remove all
susceptibility to infection, I endeavoured to possess myself with the
facts of the case. Circumstances were thus brought to my knowledge
which appear so interesting, that a brief detail of them may
not be unacceptable to some of my readers. It would seem that
vaccination might be made as great a blessing to the canine race as
it has proved to mankind:&mdash;that is to say, many experienced men
are still of that opinion. All that I heard of material import is
nearly embodied in letters I received, some years ago, from Mr.
<span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, of Neat&#8217;s Court, Isle of Sheppey, an intelligent sportsman,
much attached to coursing. As I am sure he will not object to my
doing so, I will quote largely from his notes. He writes nearly
<i>mot-&agrave;-mot</i>.</span></p>

<p id="para_574"><span class="small">574. &#8220;It is with pleasure that I answer yours of this morning,
and give you what little information I can respecting the vaccination
of my puppies. Mr. Fellowes, who resided about eight years since
at 34, Baker Street, was the first person from whom I learned anything
on the subject. He was a great breeder of bull-dogs, of all
the canine race the most difficult to save in distemper, greyhounds
being, perhaps, the next on the list.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> He told me that in twelve
years he had lost but two puppies, and those not, he believed, from
distemper, and yet he had regularly bred every year.</span></p>

<p id="para_575"><span class="small">575. &#8220;I went to town purposely to see him operate upon a clutch.
The method is very simple. Take a small piece of floss silk, and
draw the end through a needle. On about the middle of the silk
place some matter &#40;when in a proper state&#41; extracted from a child&#8217;s
arm. Unfold &#40;throw back&#41; the ear so as to be able to see the
interior part near the root. You will then perceive a little projecting
knob or kernel almost detached from the ear. With the needle
pierce through this kernel. Draw the silk each way till the blood
starts. Tie the ends of the silk, and the process is completed. You
may let the silk remain there: it will drop off after a time. The
object is to deposit the matter by this method, instead of employing
a lancet. I have great faith in the efficacy of the plan, simple as it
appears. With me it has never failed. For some years in succession
I dropped a clutch of greyhounds and two litters of setters,
and not a single pup had the distemper more severely than for the
disease to be just perceptible. A little opening medicine then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
quickly removed that slight symptom of illness. Perhaps the best
age to operate upon puppies is when they are well recovered from
their weaning.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_576"><span class="small">576. The balance of testimony and experience is, in my opinion,
quite in favour of vaccination; but there are authorities of weight
who think that no good results from it. It is, however, certain that
it cannot be productive of harm. Blaine writes that, as far as his
experience went, &#8220;vaccination neither exempts the canine race from
the attack of the distemper, nor mitigates the severity of the complaint.&#8221;
He adds, however, that the point was still at issue.</span></p>

<p id="para_577"><span class="small">577. It appears right to observe that Blaine and Jenner were
contemporaries at a period when the medical world was greatly
opposed to the vaccination of children. It is not surprising, therefore,
that there should have been an unjust prejudice against the
vaccination of puppies. Youatt is altogether silent on the subject,
although he quotes Dr. Jenner&#8217;s description of distemper. Colonel
Cook, in his observations on fox-hunting, &amp;c., says, &#8220;Vaccination
was tried in some kennels as a preventive, but it failed, and was
abandoned.&#8221; Mayhew<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> does not allude to it.</span></p>

<p id="para_578"><span class="small">578. Not until after the foregoing remarks on vaccination were
written, was I aware that Colonel Hawker recommended the plan,
or, of course, I should, in former editions, have quoted such high
authority. Speaking in 1838, he observes, &#8220;I have ever since
adopted the plan of vaccination; and so little, if any, has been the
effect of distemper after it, that I have not lost a dog since the year
1816.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;This remedy has been followed with great success both
here and in the United States. The plan adopted is to insert a
small quantity of vaccine matter under each ear, just as you would
do in the human arm.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para_579"><span class="small">579. I know of many dogs in the south of England having been
cured of a regular attack of distemper by a lump of salt, about the
size of a common marble, being occasionally forced down their
throats; say, for a grown-up pointer, half a dozen doses, with an
interval of two or three hours between each. The salt acts as an
emetic. Nourishing food and warmth are very requisite.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">MEDICINE, HOW GIVEN.</div>

<p id="para_580"><span class="small">580. To some few of my readers it may possibly be of use to
observe, that with a little management, it is very easy to trick a dog
into taking medicine.</span></p>

<p id="para_581"><span class="small">581. If your patient is a large animal, make a hole in a piece of
meat, and having wrapped the physic in thin paper, shove it into
the hole. Throw the dog one or two bits of meat, then the piece
containing the medicine, and the chances are that he will bolt it
without in the least suspecting he has been deceived. A pill,
enveloped in silver paper, emits no smell. If a powder is well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
rubbed up with butter, and a little at a time of the mixture be
smeared over the animal&#8217;s nose, he will lick it off and swallow it.
Powders can also be placed between thin slices of bread and butter,
and be so administered. If you are treating a small pampered
favourite, probably a little previous starvation will assist you.</span></p>

<p id="para_582"><span class="small">582. Should you fail in your stratagems, and force be necessary,
it will be best to lay the dog on his back, or place him in a sitting
posture between your knees, with his back towards you. In either
position his legs are useless to him, as they have no fulcrum. While
you are making him open his mouth, if you do this by forcing your
thumb and fingers between his grinders, you can effectually protect
yourself from a bite by covering them with the dog&#8217;s own lips&mdash;any
powders then placed far back on the tongue near the throat must be
swallowed on the dog&#8217;s mouth being firmly closed for a few seconds.
He will not be able to eject them as they will adhere to his moist
tongue. If given with a little dry sugar they will be the less
nauseous, and therefore the dog will be less disposed to rebel when
next you have occasion to act the part of a doctor.</span></p>

<p id="para_583"><span class="small">583. Castor oil is a valuable medicine for dogs; and it is a good
plan to let a pup occasionally lap milk into which a little of this oil
is poured, as then he will not in after life dislike the mixture.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">DOG NOT TO BE LENT.</div>

<p id="para_584"><span class="small">584. I have still one very important direction to give: <i>NEVER
LEND YOUR DOG</i>. It may seem selfish, but if you make him
a really good one, I strongly advise you never to lend him to any
one not even to a brother, unless, indeed, his method of hunting
be precisely the same as your&#8217;s. If you are a married man, you
will not, I presume, lend your wife&#8217;s horse to any one who has a
coarse hand; you would at least do it with reluctance; but you
ought &#40;I hope she will forgive my saying so&#41; to feel far more reluctance
and far more grief, should you be obliged to lend a good dog
to an ignorant sportsman or to one who shoots for the pot.</span></p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p id="para_585"><span class="small">585. Gentle Reader, according to the courteous phraseology of
old novels, though most probably I ought to say, Brother Sportsman;&mdash;if
you have had the patience to attend me through the
preceding pages, while I have been describing the educational
course of a dog from almost his infancy, up to maturity, I will
hope that I may construe that patience into an evidence that they
have afforded you some amusement and, perhaps, some useful
instruction.</span></p>

<p id="para_586"><span class="small">586. Though I may have failed in persuading you to undertake
the instruction of your dogs yourself, yet I trust I have shown you
how they ought to be broken in;<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and if you are a novice in the
field, I hope I have clearly explained to you in what manner they
ought to be shot over,&mdash;a knowledge which no one can possess by
intuition, and which you will find nearly as essential to the preservation
of the good qualities of well-tutored dogs, as to the education
of uninformed ones.</span></p>

<p id="para_587"><span class="small">587. I believe that all I have said is perfectly true, and, as the
system which I have described advocates kind treatment of man&#8217;s
most faithful companion, and his instruction with mildness rather
than severity, I trust that you will be induced to give it a fair trial,
and if you find it successful, recommend its adoption.</span></p>

<p id="para_588"><span class="small">588. I dare not ask for the same favour at the hands of the
generality of regular trainers&mdash;I have no right to expect such
liberality. They, naturally enough, will not readily forgive my
intruding upon what they consider exclusively their own domain,&mdash;and,
above all, they will not easily pardon my urging every sportsman
to break in his own dogs. They will, I know, endeavour to
persuade their employers that the finished education which I have
described is useless, or quite unattainable, without a great sacrifice
of time;<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and that, therefore, the system which I advocate is a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
one. They will wish it to be forgotten&mdash;that I advise a gradual
advance, step by step, from the A, B, C;&mdash;that accomplishments
have only been recommended <i>after</i> the acquisition of essentials&mdash;never
at the expense of essentials;&mdash;that at any moment it is in the
instructor&#8217;s power to say, &#8220;I am now satisfied with the extent of my
pupil&#8217;s acquirements, and have neither leisure nor inclination to
teach him more;&#8221;&mdash;and that they cannot suggest quicker means of
imparting any grade of education, however incomplete; at least
they do not&mdash;I wish they would; few would thank them more than
myself.</span></p>

<div class="pageheader">CAUSE OF AUTHOR&#8217;S WRITING.</div>

<p id="para_589"><span class="small">589. Greatly vexed at the erroneous way in which I saw some
dogs instructed in the north by one, who from his profession should
have known better, I promised, on the impulse of the moment, to
write. If I could have purchased any work which treated the
subject in what I considered a judicious and perspicuous manner,
and, above all, which taught by what means a <i>finished</i> education
could be imparted, I would gladly have recommended the study of
it,&mdash;have spared myself the trouble of detailing the results of my
own observations and experience,&mdash;and not have sought to impose
on any one the task of reading them. When I began the book, and
even when I had finished it, I intended to put it forth without any
token by which the writer might be discovered. Mr. Murray, however,
forcibly presented that unless the public had some guarantee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
for the fidelity of the details, there would be no chance of the little
work being circulated, or proving useful; therefore, having written
solely from a desire to assist my brother sportsmen, and to show the
injudiciousness of severity, with a wish that my readers might feel
as keen a zest for shooting as I once possessed, and with a charitable
hope that they might not be compelled to seek it in as varied
climates as was my lot, I at once annexed my address and initials
to the manuscript, but with no expectation that my pen could
interest the public half as much as it would a favourite Skye terrier,
well known in Albemarle Street.</span></p>

<h2 id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT</h2>

<p class="center">TO THE SECOND EDITION, REPRINTED IN THIS.</p>

<div class="pageheader">MR. <span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;G&#8217;S</span> LETTER.</div>

<p><span class="small">Sometime after the foregoing sheets were numbered and prepared
for the press, I received a letter on the subject of dogs and dog-breaking
from Mr. <span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;g</span> &#40;spoken of in <a href="#para_183">183</a>&#41;.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">I had long ago requested him freely to make remarks upon my
book, assuring him that as I had only written from a wish to be
serviceable, I could not but take all his comments in good part, however
much they might be opposed to my pre-conceived ideas. I
further promised to mention his criticisms for the benefit of my future
readers, if I considered them judicious.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">Every man is fully entitled to form an opinion for himself: and as
there are minor points&mdash;though on most we are fully agreed&mdash;in
which Mr. <span class="glue">L&mdash;&mdash;g</span> and myself slightly differ, I think it the fairest
plan to let him explain his own views in his own way, and I have the
less hesitation in doing so as, to most sportsmen, a letter from a clever
sportsman on his favourite subject must always be more or less interesting.
He writes nearly word for word as follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="right10">&#8220;7, <span class="smcap">Haymarket</span>, January, 1850.</p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;On perusing your book on dog-breaking I really find little,
if anything, to say that will assist you in your new edition; but I
must observe that I think you would be doing a service to the community,
if you would lend a helping hand to improve the breed of
pointers; or rather to get up a sort of committee of sportsmen
&#40;thorough judges&#41; to investigate into the pedigree of dogs, and express
their opinion of the make, nose, durability, &amp;c., of the several
animals submitted to them; that prizes might be awarded, or stakes
hunted for; and books kept of the pedigree of the several competitors,
much in the same way as such matters are managed with greyhounds.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;It is of no consequence how fast a dog travels who is wanted for
the moors, or how wide he ranges; but such a dog would be worse
than useless in the south, and in all small enclosures. I feel assured
that dogs which are first-rate on grouse are not fitted for partridge.
My experience tells me that not one dog in twenty is worth keeping,&mdash;that
the generality do far more harm than good,&mdash;this I see almost
every day that I am out. There seem to be now-a-days no recognised
thorough-bred pointers, but those obtained from one or two kennels
in Yorkshire. I have shot over many north-country dogs, but found
there was too much of the fox-hound blood in them for the south,&mdash;they
are too high-couraged, and range much too far. After the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
fortnight of partridge-shooting you want quiet, close rangers who
will never move until told. In the turnip-fields in Norfolk you will
get among lots of birds, and you may then fill your bag any day, provided
you can hunt the field in perfect quiet; but with a rattling,
blustering dog you will hardly get a shot,&mdash;yet you want a dog that
shall be neither too large nor too heavy.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;Not one dog in fifty of the many I see, properly hunts his ground.
The reason is this. The keepers in the north,&mdash;yet none understand
their duties better,&mdash;take out a lot of dogs along with an old one;
off they all start like oiled lightning&mdash;some one way, the others just
the contrary: one gets a point, they all drop and stop. The keepers
say, is not that beautiful?&mdash;is it not a picture for Landseer? I have
followed the party on the moors over the self-same ground a dozen of
times, and obtained with my brace of close rangers and good finders
double the number of shots that they did, and three times the amount
of game; for I was walking at my ease, and giving my dogs time to
make out the birds&mdash;which is very essential in the middle of the day,
when there is a scorching sun.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;I recollect one instance in particular. Some years ago I had just
arrived at the top of a very stiff hill on the Bradfield Moors &#40;in Yorkshire&#41;,
and was making for a certain spring where I had forwarded
my luncheon, and a fresh supply of ammunition, when I saw, immediately
before me, two gentlemen with their keepers, and four very
good-looking setters, hunting the precise ground I had to take to get
to my point&mdash;about a mile off. I therefore sat down for a quarter of
an hour to let them get well ahead. They found several straggling
birds; but there was such a noise from the keepers rating and
hallooing to the dogs, that, although they got five or six shots, they
only bagged one brace of birds. When they reached the spring, they
observed me coming over the very ground they had beat only a
quarter of an hour before. I got ten shots, every one to points, and
killed nine birds. I was highly complimented on the beautiful, quiet
style of my dogs, &amp;c., and was offered a goblet of as fine old sherry
as man ever drunk. I need not observe that I much relished it after
my morning&#8217;s walk. The gentlemen said, that if I felt disposed to
take the dogs to the Tontine Inn, Sheffield, when I had done with
them, I should find fifty guineas there awaiting me; but I declined
the offer, as on several occasions I had repented having yielded to the
temptation of a long price for favourite dogs. The brace I refused
to sell were young setters, bred by Tom Cruddas, keeper to&mdash;Bowes,
Esq., near Barnard Castle, Durham. I subsequently found them very
unfitted for the style of work required in small fields and indifferent
stubble, and I was well beaten in a trial with them against a brace of
Russian setters. I afterwards procured the latter by exchanging my
Englishmen for them. For two years I was much pleased with the
foreigners, and bred some puppies from them; they did not, however,
turn out to my satisfaction. I then tried a cross with some of the
best dogs I could get in England and from Russia, but could never
obtain any so good as the original stock. I have now got into a
breed of red and white pointers from the splendid stock of the late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Sir Harry Goodrich, and many and many another hundred head
of game should I have killed,&mdash;and in much greater comfort and
temper should I have shot,&mdash;had I possessed so perfect a breed twenty
years ago.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;As a proof of what can be done with dogs, I will mention that
I broke in a spaniel to hunt &#40;with my setters&#41; in the open as well as
in cover, and made him &#8216;point,&#8217; &#8216;back,&#8217; and &#8216;drop to charge,&#8217; as perfectly
as any dog you ever saw; and he would, when ordered, retrieve
his game; the setter, meanwhile, never moving until desired. I shot
over them for two years. They were a very killing pair, but had not
a sporting look. In September, &#8217;38, I took them with me to that
excellent sportsman, Sir Richard Sutton. The old Squire Osbaldiston,
was there. They were both much pleased with the dogs. By letting
my poor pet &#8216;Dash&#8217; run about, he was bitten by a mad dog in the
neighbourhood. Of course I lost him.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;Speaking of spaniels, I must say I think that there is no kind of
dog that retrieves birds so well in thick turnips, where so much dead
and wounded game is frequently left unbagged. With &#8216;Dash&#8217; I
seldom lost a feather in the strongest turnips in the course of a whole
day; but I now rarely go out with sportsmen but that I see two or
three birds lost,&mdash;sometimes more,&mdash;from what are <i>said</i> to be the
best breed of retrievers in the country. The constant loss of wounded
birds is one of the drawbacks to the Norfolk shooting, where, without
doubt, the finest shooting in England is to be obtained. Gentlemen
there go out, some four, five, or six in a line, with only one or two
retrievers, and a man to each to pick up the killed game. The sportsmen
never stop to load, for each has generally a man by his side with
a spare gun ready charged. If a bird is winged, or a hare wounded,
the dogs go in at once to fetch it. Were the sportsmen to divide into
distinct parties, each party taking one or two steady, close-ranging
dogs, what much more true sport and pleasure they would have!&mdash;and
kill, too, quite as much game.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;You ask me wherein I differ from you in what you have written?
Certainly in very little,&mdash;and I have sent several gentlemen to
Murray&#8217;s for copies of your book; but in page 3, you say that &#8216;dog-breaking
does not require much experience.&#8217; There I cannot agree
with you,&mdash;for how is it that there are so few who understand it?
Not one keeper or gentleman in a thousand, in my opinion. The
reason is that they have not sufficient practice and experience.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;In another point I differ with you. I have seen some of the best
rangers I ever shot over made by being allowed to follow their mother
in the field, or some very old dog,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>&mdash;what some people would term a
worn-out potterer. But I think it a yet better plan to attach a lay-cord
of about forty yards in length to the collar of the young dog,
and let a man or boy hold the other end. You will give a slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
whistle when he gets to the extremity of his range, and a wave of
the hand to turn him forward or back.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> By such means I have seen
dogs, with a few days&#8217; constant shooting, made perfect in that,&mdash;the
<i>most essential</i> thing in all dog-breaking.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;I observe that you condemn the check-collar<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> <i>in toto</i>. I think
you are wrong. I have seen dogs cured by it who would not drop to
shot, but would perpetually rush in, especially if a wounded bird was
fluttering near them, and who had been most unmercifully licked, to
no useful purpose. I recollect orders being given to destroy a dog
that appeared utterly incorrigible. As he was a beautiful &#8216;finder,&#8217; I
begged that he might be allowed one more trial. I sent to town for
a check-collar, and in a few hours he was pulled head over heels half-a-dozen
times. He then found out what he was punished for, squatted
down accordingly, and never afterwards attempted to rush forward,
unless he was over-fresh. You speak of hares not annoying your
dogs in Scotland. I have been sadly annoyed by them when grouse-shooting
there. In one part, from hares jumping up every five
minutes, I had great difficulty in restraining my dogs from chasing;
and on this occasion I found the check-collar quite a blessing,&mdash;for
had I used the whip I should have been thrown off my shooting, and
the noise would have disturbed the birds. I had at the time two of
the best shots in England shooting against me, and I should to a
certainty have been beaten had I not been so prudent as to take out
the collar.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;I remember selling to a young officer a brace of my puppies, or
rather young dogs &#40;for they were eighteen months old&#41;, for twenty-five
guineas. They were well broken, but had not been shot over.
He had not been an hour on the moors before up started one of the
small Scotch sheep. Both the dogs gave chase, and on their return
the keeper was directed to give them a good dressing. One of them
would not hunt for them again, and became so timid that the officer
desired the keeper to get rid of it. It was given to a gentleman in
the neighbourhood, who knew he could not be far away in accepting
it, as it had been bred and sold by me. He took it out a few times
and soon found out its value. The other dog the officer sold for 10<i>l.</i>,
and then wrote a very angry letter to me, complaining of my having
sold him such a brace as well broken. A fortnight after this he invited
the gentleman who had become possessor of the shy puppy to
come and shoot with him. The gentleman made his appearance with,
what he termed, his &#8216;shy friend.&#8217; After many protestations against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
taking out such a brute, it was agreed that it should be done on the
gentleman&#8217;s offering to bet 5<i>l.</i> that his &#8216;shy friend&#8217; would get more
points than either of the dogs they proposed hunting; and another
5<i>l.</i> that he should prove himself the best broken of the dogs, and
never during the whole day offer to chase hare or sheep. The bets
were not made, but to show you the esteem in which his late master
afterwards held the animal, he offered fifty guineas to get her back,
but the money was refused. His brother also turned out a magnificent
dog&mdash;so much for want of patience.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;It is just possible that all I have written may be of no use,&mdash;but
should you find it of any, it is quite at your service. Since I last saw
you I have had many more opportunities of observing the extraordinary
nose of the dog I showed you&mdash;a quality in which I fancy forty-nine
out of fifty dogs are deficient. I sent him down to Hickfield-place,
Hants, for the Speaker, who is an excellent sportsman, to use for a
few times to see if he was not superior to his dogs. He returned the
dog with a very handsome basket of game, saying he was one of the
finest dogs he had ever seen hunted, and he begged me to get him a
brace of the same kind against next season; stating that the price
would be no consideration if they proved as good as mine. I have
tried him against many other old dogs, <i>said</i> to be &#8216;the best in England,&#8217;
but not one of them had a shadow of a chance against him. I
have refused a very long price for him. For beauty, style, symmetry,
nose, durability, and good temper &#40;a great thing&#41;, none can beat him.
I should like to increase his breed for the sake of the shooting community;
yet I have no wish to keep him publicly as a sire, nor to
send him away. I think I should be doing a general benefit, if I gave
it out that his services could be obtained for three guineas: and that
the sums thus obtained were to be set aside as a prize for the best
dog, to be contended for by competitors who should give 3<i>l.</i> or 5<i>l.</i>
each. Something of this kind, could, I think, be managed, and it would
greatly tend to improve our breed of pointers. I bought a bitch with
the view of getting some pups by him. She had nine, but not one
like the father, grandfather, or great-grandfather&mdash;so I sold her,
puppies and all. I have just purchased another; she comes of an
excellent stock, and has good shape. I shall see what luck I have
with her. She is a far more likely dam.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;I should have written to you long ago, had I not expected to
meet the person I term my Yorkshire breeder. He is <i>the best breaker
I ever saw</i>, and a man you can depend upon. He and his father, for
sixty years, have borne as high a character for honesty, as for excellence
in breaking. Many a time has he contended, and always come
off victor, against Mr. Edge&#8217;s dogs&mdash;a good trial kennel, but the
breed have savage dispositions, bad tempers, and are very unmanageable
when young. I have tried many of them myself, and
have no faith in them.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;On the moors, when the work is excessively fatiguing, and
plenty of water is generally to be found, you may with advantage
employ setters: but in a hot September, in England, when no water
could be procured, I have known some of the best setters I ever saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
do nothing but put up the birds. In mid-day, when there was but
little scent, their nasal organs seemed quite to fail them, and being
fast they constantly ran into coveys before they could stop themselves.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">&#8220;I was once asked to be umpire in a match between a pointer and
a setter. It was to be decided by which of the dogs got most points
in the day. As this was the agreement, I was obliged to abide by it
and decide accordingly: but that is not the test by which the superiority
of dogs ought to be determined. I presume what is really
wanted in a dog is <i>usefulness to his master in killing game</i>. If so, that
dog ought to be considered best which gets his master most shots
within a rise not exceeding forty yards.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The setter being faster and
taking a much wider range, got by far the most points, therefore I
was compelled to award him the prize; but the pointer made twenty-two
points to which the party got twenty-one shots. The setter got
thirty points, but only sixteen of them could be shot to, and he put
up thrice as many birds as the pointer. I could mention twenty
other similar instances of trials between pointers and setters, but I
should fill half-a-dozen more sheets and not interest you. It is getting
dark, so I will conclude my long yarn.</span></p>

<h3><a name="note_to_65" id="note_to_65"></a><span class="smcap">Note to</span> 65.&mdash;<i><span class="glue">Covers.</span></i>&mdash;<i><span class="glue">Shooting.</span></i>&mdash;<i><span class="glue">Loading.</span></i></h3>

<p><span class="small">What convenient covers they are&mdash;and what excellent shelter they
furnish for game, when planted with holly, laurel, and other evergreens!&mdash;especially
if the proprietor, in a moment of sporting
enthusiasm, has consented to his keeper&#8217;s request, and had some of
the trees half-felled, so that the branches lying on the ground live
and grow, deriving nourishment from the sap still flowing through
the uncut bark. Perhaps gorse forms the best ground cover for the
preservation of game; but it is far from being the most agreeable to
shoot in. It has, however, a great merit&mdash;it is much disliked by
poachers. There should be good roosting-trees; and the different
kinds of fir&mdash;spruce particularly&mdash;give most security, their thick,
spreading branches affording much concealment at all seasons of the
year. They are, too, of quick growth. But the most favourably
planted covers will prove unattractive unless there is a constant
supply of water within a reasonable distance. An old brother officer
of mine, who has property in Suffolk, argues,&mdash;and most will think
correctly,&mdash;that for the preservation of game, beltings should not run
round the external part of an estate &#40;as is often the case,&#41; but lie well
within it, and at some distance from a high road.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">Talking of beltings and pheasants, as some sporting Griffin &#40;to use
an Indian expression&#41; may come across this book, I may as well, for
his sake, mention, that pheasants are generally prevented from running
to the further end of a belting, and then rising in one dense
cloud, by a man sent ahead striking two sticks together, or making
some other slight noise which, without too much alarming the birds,
yet prevents their running past him. As the guns approach him he
gets further forward and takes up another position, keeping wide of
the cover whilst he is on the move. Should the Griffin make one of
the shooting party, he is advised to bear in mind that the guns should
keep close to the hedge &#40;or rails&#41;, that any game on the point of
&#8220;breaking&#8221; may not so readily observe them, and in consequence
beat a retreat. By-the-bye, my young friend, should you wish your
host to give you another invitation to his covers never let him see
you carrying your barrels horizontally. If you are a bit of a soldier
you will know what I mean when I say that, combining due preparation
for prompt action with security to him who may be skirmishing
near, your gun can be conveniently borne across the open at the &#8220;Slope
arms&#8221; of the sergeant&#8217;s fusil. When you are in cover &#40;or your dog
draws upon game&#41;, it might be carried much in the position of &#8220;Port
arms.&#8221; At the moment you level, following the example of the best
pigeon shots, place your left hand well in advance of the poise. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
you have any fears of the barrels bursting, leave them at home. Your
steadiest position is with the elbow held nearly perpendicularly under
the gun: whereas your right elbow ought to be almost in a horizontal
line with your shoulder, thus furnishing a convenient hollow
for the reception of the butt. The firmer you grasp the stock the less
is the recoil. That amusing fellow Wanostrocht, in his work on
cricketing &#40;&#8220;Felix on the Bat&#8221;&#41;, writes, &#8220;The attitude of <i>en garde</i>
of the left-handed swordsman is the attitude of <i>play</i> for the right-handed
batsman,&#8221;&mdash;and you, my supposed Griffin, may rest assured
that it is the best position your feet and legs can take on a bird&#8217;s
rising, but the right foot might be with advantage a little more to the
right. Wanostrocht continues, &#8220;The knees are bent; and the body,
well balanced, is prepared,&#8221; you may add, &#8220;to turn steadily to the
right or left according to the flight of the bird.&#8221; In nine cases out
of ten the common advice to &#8220;keep both eyes open&#8221; when firing is
extremely judicious. But some men are &#8220;left-eyed;&#8221; a matter you
have probably little thought about; and yet it is of consequence, for
if you are &#8220;left-eyed,&#8221; your aim from the right shoulder &#40;both eyes
being open&#41; cannot be correct. To determine whether or not you
are &#8220;right-eyed,&#8221; look steadily, with both eyes open, at any small
object near you,&mdash;rapidly raise a finger &#40;of either hand&#41; perpendicularly,
endeavouring to cover the object. Instantly close the left eye. If
you find that your finger lies in the direct line between the object and
your right eye, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are
&#8220;right-eyed;&#8221; but if your finger, instead of intercepting the object,
is wide of the mark, at once close the right eye and open the left,
when you will, in all probability, perceive that your finger lies
directly between your left eye and the object, thereby showing that
you are &#8220;left-eyed.&#8221; I hope it may not be so, as, unless you can
shoot from the left shoulder, you ought to close the left eye when
bringing your gun to the poise, until from practice you become
&#8220;right-eyed.&#8221; The odds are in favour of your being right-legged as
well as right-eyed, which important point will be settled, I hope to
your satisfaction, should you ever be under the disagreeable necessity
of having to kick an impertinent fellow downstairs. Never
shoot in a hurry. Strive to acquire coolness&mdash;in other words, strive
to acquire such a command over your trigger-finger that it shall never
bend until so ordered by your judgment. Your eye will inform your
reason of the exact moment when you ought to pull, and your finger,
submissive to reason, ought to wait for that precise moment, and not
yield to any nervousness. Look with the <i>greatest intensity</i> at the bird
as it rises, and coolly observe its line of flight while deliberately
bringing the barrels to your shoulder. Steadiness will be increased
by your not removing the gun from your shoulder the instant you
have fired. Never fire when your shot can be of no more advantage
than a single bullet. If you have a bet about killing a jack snipe,
seize the favourable moment for pulling the trigger when the pellets
will be spread over a disk of more than a yard in diameter. He will
then be zigzagging some thirty-five or forty yards from you; and if
your aim is taken at this moment a full foot in advance of his <i>general</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
line of flight, there is little chance of his escaping unpeppered &#40;and
one grain will suffice&#41;, however adroitly he may turn and twist. For
any kind of bird flying at that distance rapidly down wind and crossing
you, your gun ought to be pitched <i>much</i> further forward. A
still greater allowance should be made if the distance be considerable:
and greater elevation should be then given to the barrels, as the
grains of shot will become deflected. The same rule holds with birds
rising. Aim must be taken above them. There is always more fear
of your firing too much to the rear and too low, than too much to the
front and too high. Fancy that hares and rabbits have only heads&mdash;and
get into the habit of looking at no other part,&mdash;nay, of looking
yet further ahead. The best cover-shot I know says, that he aims at
a rabbit rushing through gorse or underwood a yard in front of the
spot where he last caught a glimpse of it. Rabbits halt for a moment
the instant they get hidden by cover&mdash;not so hares. That their
hands and eyes may work in unison, novices have been recommended
to hang on the flight of swallows with an unloaded gun. It would
be better practice to hang on a full foot or more in front of the birds.
To save your locks use snap caps, and pull the very instant you
think your aim is correct. No second aim can be so effective as
the first. The more you thus practise &#40;and at game especially, in
order to overcome any nervous sensation occasioned by birds rising&#41;
before you commence using powder, the more certain is it that
you will eventually become a cool, steady shot. After having commenced
the campaign in right earnest, should you be shooting unsteadily
or nervously, you would do well to have the philosophy
to go up a few times to your dog&#8217;s point with uncapped nipples, and
by taking &#40;long after the birds are on the wing, but yet within
shot&#41; a deliberate aim reassure yourself of the folly of all hurry and
precipitancy. Lest you should &#40;as often happens in spite of every
previous resolution&#41; involuntarily pull the trigger sooner than you
intend, keep your finger off it until the very instant you wish to fire.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
If you shoot with a muzzle loader and carry one of Sykes&#8217;s spring-shot
pouches&mdash;at present in such general use&mdash;by having its nozzle
lengthened &#40;some few are made long&#41;,&mdash;I mean by having a cylinder
of nearly three inches in length welded to its end,&mdash;you will be able
to load quicker than most of your fellow-sportsmen&mdash;particularly if
you use a loading-rod: the best are of cane, because the material is
light and tough. You can make the long nozzle of the shot-pouch
&#40;its end being cut square, <i>i.e.</i> at a right angle to its length&#41; force the
wad over the powder so far down the barrel before you press the
pouch-spring to pour in the charge of shot, that you need not draw
your ramrod to drive home until after you have inserted the shot-wad.
Using a long nozzle has also this great advantage, that the
shot is packed more densely than the powder. In the new German
copper cap musket &#40;whose long range is now, 1854, much spoken of,&#41;
to keep the powder loose when the charge is rammed home, a thick
peg, nearly one and a half inches long, is fixed longitudinally in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
centre of the chamber,&mdash;I mean, in the direction of the axis of the
bore. This cylindrical peg, which is much like the <i>tige</i> invented by
Colonel Touvenin in 1828, arrests the <i>jagged</i> bullet at the precise
moment when the powder is sufficiently pressed to remove all chance
of the <i>slightly</i> six-grooved barrel&#8217;s bursting; and yet not so much
pressed as to interfere with the complete ignition of <i>every</i> grain.
These lie loose round the peg. The want of this complete ignition
&#40;owing to the rapidity of explosion not giving time for all the particles
of closely-wedged powder being fired&#41; has been the only valid
objection yet offered to the detonating system. For strong shooting,
the wad over the powder should be <i>much</i> thicker than the wad placed
over the shot. The several waddings now sold greased with some
mercurial preparation undeniably retard leading&mdash;a great gain. If
the long nozzle of the shot-pouch fits close within the barrel, on unloading
your gun you can easily return the shot into the pouch
without losing a grain. As a concluding piece of advice let me
recommend you, my young friend, to make but a light breakfast
whenever you expect a heavy day&#8217;s work,&mdash;take out, however, a
few sandwiches for luncheon.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">A good book for gamekeepers on trapping is still a great desideratum.
It should be written by a practical man who is a bit of a
naturalist; for no trapper can be very successful unless he is well
acquainted with the haunts and habits of the many kinds of vermin it
is his business to destroy. Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;e&#8217;s</span> gamekeeper, at <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;n</span>,
Perthshire, who was well aware of the great importance of diligently
searching for their nests in the breeding season, was at length amply
repaid for often watching the proceedings of a hen-harrier frequently
seen hovering over a small wood not far from his cottage. He could
never perceive that she alighted on any of the trees; but from the
time of year, and her so perseveringly returning to the spot, he felt
convinced that her nest was not far off. Ineffectual, however, was
every search. At length, one morning he was lucky enough to
remark that something fell from her. He hunted close in that direction,&mdash;found
the nest, and the young ones regaling on a snipe whose
remains were still warm; evidently the identical bird she had most
adroitly dropped from a considerable height into the middle of her
hungry brood. It would have been very interesting to have observed
how she managed on a windy day. Probably she would have taken
an easy shot by sweeping close to the trees. In Germany much
winged vermin is destroyed with the aid of a decoy horned owl. The
keeper having selected a favourable spot on a low hillock where the
bird is likely to be observed, drives an upright post into the ground,
the upper part of which is hollowed. The bird is placed on a perch
much shaped like the letter <b>T</b>. A string is attached to the
bottom of the perpendicular part, which is then dropped into the
hollow or socket. The armed keeper conceals himself in a loopholed
sentry-box, prepared of green boughs, at a suitable distance, amidst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
sheltering foliage. His pulling the string raises the perch. The owl,
to preserve its balance, flutters its wings. This is sure to attract the
notice of the neighbouring magpies, hawks, crows, &amp;c. Some from
curiosity hover about, or, still chattering and peering, alight on the
neighbouring trees &#40;of course, standing invitingly within gun-shot&#41;;
others, having no longer any reverence for the bird of Wisdom in his
present helpless condition, wheel round and round, every moment
taking a sly peck at their fancied enemy, while their real foe sends
their death-warrant from his impervious ambuscade.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">Talking of vermin, I am reminded that <span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;d</span>, an old
gamekeeper with whom I am acquainted, avers that one of his craft
can hardly be worth his salt unless he possesses &#8220;a regular good
varmint of a dog.&#8221; It should be of a dark colour, not to betray so
readily the movements of his master to interested parties. He says
he once owned one, a bull-terrier, that was, to again quote the old
man&#8217;s words, &#8220;worth his weight in gold to a gamekeeper;&#8221; that it
was incredible the quantity of ground-vermin, of every kind, the dog
killed, which included snakes and adders&mdash;destroyers of young birds
of every sort, and it is said of eggs &#40;but this it is difficult to conceive,
unless we imagine them to be crushed in the same manner as the
boa-constrictor murders his victims, a supposition without a shadow
of proof&mdash;small eggs, however, might be swallowed whole&#41;,&mdash;that he
was perpetually hunting, but never noticed game&mdash;had an excellent
nose, and, on occasions when he could not run into the vermin,
would unerringly lead his master to the hole in the old bank, tree, or
pile of fagots where it had taken refuge; when, if it was a stoat or
weasel, and in a place where the report of a gun was not likely to
disturb game, the keeper would bring him into &#8220;heel,&#8221; wait patiently
awhile, and then, by imitating the cry of a distressed rabbit, endeavour
to entice the delinquent to come forth and be shot. If this <i>ruse</i>
failed, <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;d</span> quickly prepared a trap that generally sealed the fate
of the destructive little creature. As the dog retrieved all he caught,
the old barn-door was always well covered with <i>recent</i> trophies. Old
trophies afford no evidence of a keeper&#8217;s diligence.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">The dog invariably accompanied his master during his rounds at
night, and had great talents for discovering any two-legged intruder.
On finding one he would quietly creep up, and then, by running
round and round him as if prepared every moment to make a spring,
detain him until joined by the keeper; all the while barking furiously
and adroitly avoiding every blow aimed at his sconce.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="small">He was moreover &#40;but this has little to do with his sporting
habits&#41;, a most formidable enemy to dogs of twice his power; for he
would cunningly throw himself upon his back if overmatched, and
take the same unfair advantage of his unfortunate opponent which
Polygars are trained to do when they are attacking the wild hog
&#40;<a href="#para_445">445</a>&#41;.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">I relate this story about <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;d</span> and his bull-terrier because few
men ever were so successful in getting up a good show of game on a
property. It was a favourite observation of his that it was not
game,&mdash;it was vermin, that required looking after; that these did
more injury than the largest gang of poachers, as the depredations
of the latter could be stopped, but not those of the former. There
are few who, on reflection, will not agree with the old keeper. Stoats
are so bloodthirsty, that if one of them come across a brood of young
pheasants he will give each in succession a deadly gripe on the back
of the neck close to the skull, not to make any use of the carcasses,
but in the epicurean desire to suck their delicate brains. All who are
accustomed to &#8220;rabbiting&#8221; know that even tame ferrets evince the
same murderous propensities, and commit indiscriminate slaughter,
<i>apparently</i> in the spirit of wanton destructiveness.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">From all, however, that I have seen and heard, I fancy no animal
so much prevents the increase of partridges and pheasants, as the
hooded crow.</span></p>

<p><span class="small">An intelligent man, <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;n</span> &#40;an admirable dresser of
salmon-flies&#41;, whose veracity I have no reason to distrust, assured me
that he had seen about the nest of a &#8220;hoodie&#8221; &#40;as he called the
bird&#41;, the shells of not less than two hundred eggs, all nearly of the
partridge and pheasant. He told me that he once had an opportunity
of observing the clever proceedings of a pair of these marauders, bent
on robbing the nest on which a hen-pheasant was actually sitting. One
of the depredators by fluttering round her, and slily pecking at her
unprotected stern, at length so succeeded in irritating her, that she
got up to punish him. By a slow scientific retreat, he induced her
to pursue him for a few steps, thus affording his confederate, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>had concealed himself, the opportunity of removing certainly one egg,
perhaps two. By repetitions of this sham attack and retreat, the
adroit pilferers eventually managed to empty the nest.</span></p>

<p>The above mentioned man had been brought up as a gamekeeper
in Cumberland. He became an excellent trapper; and was afterwards
employed on an estate near the Cheviot Hills, where, in a short time,
he got up a decent stock of game by destroying the vermin. He
found the grounds swarming with &#8220;hoodies;&#8221; but it was not until
their breeding season the following spring, when he was favoured in
his operations by a frost, that he succeeded in capturing them in
considerable numbers. On the ground becoming hard, he, for nearly
a fortnight, fed certain spots on the banks of the Teviot with wood
pigeons and rabbits, besides any vermin that he contrived to shoot.
By that time the &#8220;hoodies&#8221; habitually resorted, without distrust, to
those places for food. He then set his traps baited with all such
delicacies,&mdash;but he considered a small rabbit, or a pigeon lying on its
back with outstretched wings, as the most tempting of his invitations;
and it often happened that he had scarcely disappeared before the
click of the closing spring apprised him of a capture. When his frequent
success had rendered the birds shy, he set his traps in the
adjacent stream, covering their sides with grass or rushes,&mdash;the
attractive bait alone appearing above the surface. For three reasons
he regarded the banks of the river as the best situation for his traps&mdash;he
could, as just mentioned, conceal them in the water on the birds
becoming too suspicious&mdash;secondly, streams are much resorted to by
the &#8220;hoodie,&#8221; who searches diligently for any chance food floating on
the water,&mdash;and lastly, the rooks, of which there were many in that
part of the country, from naturally hunting inland, the reverse of the
&#8220;hoodie,&#8221; were the less likely to spring his traps.</p>

<p>From the short, fuller neck,&mdash;the head bent peeringly downwards,&mdash;but,
above all, from the hawk-like movements of the wing, the
sportsman will be able to distinguish the hooded-crow from the rook
at a moment when he may be too distant to observe the black and
more hooked bill,&mdash;and never let him spare. He should be suspicious
of every bird he sees crossing and re-crossing a field,&mdash;in reality hunting
it with as regular a beat as a pointer&#8217;s.</p>

<p><span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;n</span> killed a great many stoats and weasels with <i>unbaited</i>
traps. As it is the habit of these little animals, when hunting a hedge-row,
to prefer running through a covered passage to turning aside,
he used, where the ground favoured him by slightly rising, to
cut a short drain, about a foot in breadth, and rather less in depth,
parallel and close to the hedge, covering it with the sods he had
removed. At the bottom of these drains he fixed his traps, as soon
as the animals became accustomed to the run, and rarely failed in
securing every member of the weasel family which had taken up its
abode in the vicinity. The best description of hutch-trap &#40;which
many prefer to the gin-trap&#41; is made entirely of wire, excepting
the bottoms. All appears so light and airy that little suspicion is
awakened. The doors fall on anything running over the floor. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
course, this trap is baited unless set in a run. An enticing bait is
<i>drawn</i> towards it from several distant points.</p>

<p>To many keepers it <i>ought</i> to be of much advantage to read Colquhoun&#8217;s
advice on trapping, appended to &#8220;The Moor and the Loch.&#8221;</p>

<p>With respect to rearing pheasants under a barn-door hen, he observed
that they required <i>meat</i> daily. He said that he had been in
the habit of shooting rabbits for those he had brought up, and of
giving them the boiled flesh when cut up into the smallest pieces,
mixed with their other food. He remarked, farther, that the chicks
ought to be allowed to run upon the grass at <i>dawn</i> of day&mdash;which
was seldom regularly done, such early rising being at times not
equally congenial to the taste of all the parties concerned.</p>

<p>The treatment he recommended seems reasonable, for those who
have watched the habits of pheasants must have remarked that,
immediately upon quitting their roosts, they commence searching in
the moist grass for food &#40;greatly to the benefit of the farmer&#41;, and
do not resort to the corn-fields until after the dew is off the ground,
and the rising sun has warned the grubs, slugs, worms, and caterpillars
to seek concealment.</p>

<p>Ornithologists, and men who have studied the subject, are agreed
that partridges in a yet larger degree benefit the agriculturalist by
picking up, during the greater part of the year, myriads of worms
and insects; besides consuming immense quantities of weeds and
their seeds. They rival the ill-used mole in the number of wire-worm
they destroy. These facts have been incontrovertibly proved
by an examination of the crops of the birds at all seasons.</p>

<p>I am not wishing to fight any battles for hares and rabbits. They
do great mischief,&mdash;but in fairness it must be said for the hare, that
he commits far less waste and havoc than the other. A rabbit will
wander from turnip to turnip, nibbling a bit from each, whereby the
air is admitted<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and the whole root destroyed; whereas a hare, if
undisturbed, will sit down before one head, and not move until she
has devoured the whole of its contents, merely leaving a rind not
much thicker than an egg-shell. It is, however, undeniable that
both of them do much mischief to young plantations at all seasons of
the year, and they will even eat the bark off, and so kill some kinds
of full-grown trees, when snow is on the ground and food scarce.</p>

<p>To the health of many, usually considered only grain-feeding birds,
a certain portion of animal food appears essential. It is not solely for
grain that the common fowl scrapes the dung-hill. Throw a bone of
a cooked brother or sister to a brood of chickens confined in a
poultry-yard, and see with what avidity they will demolish the
remains of their defunct relative. Fowls never fatten on board ship;
<i>occasionally</i> owing to want of gravel,&mdash;<i>constantly</i> to want of animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
food. In a long voyage a bird that dies in a coop is often found by
&#8220;Billyducks&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> half eaten up; and it is questionable whether a
sickly companion be not occasionally sacrificed by his stronger
associates to appease their natural craving for flesh. In the West
Indies the accidental upsetting of an old sugar-cask in a farm-yard,
and its scattering forth a swarm of cock-roaches, sets all the
feathered tribe in a ferment. The birds that had been listlessly
sauntering about, or standing half-asleep in the friendly shade, suddenly
seem animated with the fury of little imps,&mdash;and, influenced
by a taste <i>in every way</i> repugnant to our feelings, with outstretched
necks and fluttering wings race against each other for possession of
the offensive, destructive insects, evincing in the pursuit an agility
and a rapidity of movement of which few would imagine them to be
capable.</p>

<p>The keeper just spoken of used to rear his pheasants within
doors, or rather in an outhouse, the floor of which was in part
covered with sods of turf,&mdash;but I think <span class="glue">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, another of
the craft whom I know well, pursues a better and far less troublesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
plan. He selects a piece of clover<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> facing the south, and
sheltered from the north and east winds by a contiguous small copse
which he feels assured can harbour no destructive vermin. On this
grass-plat, if the weather is fine, he places the common barn-door
hens,&mdash;each with her brood the moment they are hatched,&mdash;under
separate small coops. Two or three boards run from each coop,
forming a temporary enclosure, which is removed in about a week
on the little inmates gaining strength. If he has any fear of their
being carried off by hawks, &amp;c., he fixes a net overhead. The hens
had sat on the eggs in an outhouse.</p>

<p>The first food given to the chicks is soaked bread,&mdash;and white of
eggs cut up fine. The colour &#40;is not that a bull?&#41; catches their eye,
which is the alleged reason for all their food being given to them
white. Ants&#8217; nests are procured for them,&mdash;of the red ant first,&mdash;of
the larger kind, when the chicks become so strong that the insects
cannot injure them&mdash;later in the season, wasps&#8217; nests. When there
is a difficulty in procuring any of these nests, curd is often given;
but should it become sour, as frequently happens in hot weather, it
is likely to occasion dysentery,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> therefore oatmeal porridge made
with milk is considered a safer diet. This is eagerly picked up
when scattered about, sprinkled as it were,&mdash;and the weaker chicks
are thus enabled to secure a fair share. <span class="glue">T&mdash;&mdash;n</span> breeds a quantity
of maggots for them,&mdash;and at no expense,&mdash;in the adjacent copse.
Whatever vermin he kills &#40;whether winged or four-footed&#41; he hangs
up under a slight awning as a protection from the rain. On the
flesh decaying the maggots drop into the box placed underneath to
receive them. The insects soon become clean, if sand and bran is
laid at the bottom of the box, and it is an interesting sight to see
the excited little birds eagerly hurrying from all quarters to the
grass-plat on the keeper striking the tray with his knuckles to invite
them to partake of some choice maggots, spread out on sanded
boards.</p>

<p>If a piece of carrion is placed under a wire netting near the
coops, the chicks will feed with avidity on the flies it attracts.</p>

<p>Change of food is beneficial:&mdash;therefore, boiled barley or rice, is
often substituted, or oatmeal, or Indian-corn meal,&mdash;mixed with the
flesh of boiled rabbits.</p>

<p>Saucers of clean water are placed about. Water in a dirty state
is very injurious. It is not of any depth, lest the chicks should wet
their feathers when standing in it. Occasionally iron saucers are
used, ingeniously designed on the ridge and furrow plan. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>ridges are so little apart, that the chicks can insert no more than
their heads into the furrows. As cleanliness must in all things
be preserved, the coops are shifted a few feet aside twice a day.</p>

<p>The chicks soon quit the hens to roost in the shrubs, which afford
welcome shade during the mid-day heat; but the imprisoned
matrons are still useful, as their plaintive call prevents the chicks
from becoming irreclaimable truants. As they have always the
opportunity of running in the grass and copse, where they find seeds
and insects, they quickly become independent, and learn to forage
for themselves,&mdash;yet when fully grown up they are not so likely to
stray away as birds who have been more naturally reared, and who
have been made wanderers even in their infancy. This is a great
advantage.</p>

<p>That the chicks may come upon fresh ground for seeds and insects,
the situation of the coops may be occasionally changed. If liable to
be attacked by vermin at night, a board can be fixed in front of each
coop.</p>

<p>Partridges may be reared by the same means. But instances are
rare of their laying while in a state of captivity.</p>

<p>That the young birds may be able to rid their bodies of vermin,
they should be provided with small heaps of sand protected from
rain, and dry earth, in which they will gladly rub themselves.</p>

<p>If you design rearing pheasants annually, always keep a few of the
tame hens and a cock at home. By judicious management these will
supply a large quantity of eggs for hatching,&mdash;eggs that you can
ensure, when in their freshest state, being placed under barn-door
hens. Keep the eggs in a cool place. I cannot believe that you
will ever be guilty&mdash;for it is guilt, great guilt&mdash;of the sin of <i>purchasing</i>
eggs. &#8220;Buyers make thieves,&#8221;&mdash;and one sneaking, watching, unwinged
pilferer on two legs would do more mischief in the month of
May than dozens of magpies or hooded crows.</p>

<p>Pheasants so soon hunt for their own subsistence, that they are
brought to maturity at less expense than common fowls.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the second edition, I have had an opportunity
of talking to Mr. Cantelo, the clever inventor of the novel
hatching machine, whereby &#40;following nature&#8217;s principle&#41; heat is
imparted only to the upper surface of eggs. He annually rears
a large quantity of all kinds of poultry, besides partridges and
pheasants, and I believe no one in England is so experienced in these
matters.</p>

<p>He found it best not to give food to any kind of chicks for the
two first days after they were hatched. As they would not all break
the shell together, it is probable that in a state of nature many of
them would be for, at least, this period under the hen before she
led them forth to feed. To young turkeys and pheasants he gave
no food for three days. They would then eat almost anything
voraciously, whereas, when fed sooner, they become dainty and
fastidious.</p>

<p>He recommends that the lean of raw beef, or any meat &#40;minced
fine, as if for sausages&#41; be given to partridge or pheasant chicks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
along with their other food,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> or rather before their other food, and
only in certain quantities; for if they are fed too abundantly on
what they most relish, they are apt to gorge themselves, and
they will seldom refuse meat, however much grain they may have
previously eaten. He said that they should be liberally dieted, but
not to repletion,&mdash;that once a day they should be sensible of the
feeling of hunger.</p>

<p>It certainly is most consonant to nature, that the flesh given to
the chicks should not be cooked; and Mr. Cantelo observed that it
would be immediately found on trial, that young birds prefer that
which is undressed,&mdash;nay, that which has a bloody appearance.</p>

<p>He considers maggots &#40;gentles&#41; an admirable diet, and he gave me
a valuable hint about them. This is, that they be fattened on
untainted meat, placed in the sand-box into which they fall. The
pieces of meat will soon be drilled like a honey-comb, and the little
crawlers, by becoming in a day or two large and fat, will prove a
far more nourishing diet than when given in the attenuated state to
which they are commonly reduced, by the present starving process of
cleansing.</p>

<p>Mr. Cantelo has remarked that guinea-birds require food at an
earlier period after they are hatched than any other sort of chick,&mdash;and
that they and ducklings eat most meat,&mdash;turkey-poultry
least.</p>

<p>Wet is injurious to all chickens &#40;the duck-tribe excepted&#41;; and
when the hen, from being confined, cannot lead her brood astray,
they will, of themselves, return to her coop on finding the grass too
damp.</p>

<p>Mr. Cantelo is strongly of opinion, that all diseases to which
infant birds are liable are contagious. He advises, in consequence,
that the moment any one of the brood is attacked with diarrh&oelig;a,
sore eyes, or sneezing, it be instantly separated from the others.</p>

<p>He considers all chickens safe from ordinary diseases on their
gaining their pen-feathers.</p>

<p>He has found that <i>nest</i> eggs, not sat on for twelve hours, do not
lose their vitality. This shows that eggs taken by mowers should
not be hastily thrown away, in consequence of a considerable delay
unavoidably occurring before they can be placed under a hen to
complete their hatching.</p>

<p>Pheasants sit about five days longer than common fowls.</p>

<p>Mr. Cantelo recommends that eggs sent from a distance be packed
in oats. He had succeeded in hatching some he had kept, as an
experiment, upwards of two months in a temperate atmosphere,
<i>turning them daily</i>. This continued vitality is, however, seldom a
consideration as regards pheasants; for the earlier in the season the
birds can be produced the better. It is a great advantage to have
five months&#8217; growth and feed in them by the first of October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Knox, in his interesting work on &#8220;Game-birds and Wildfowl,&#8221;
has given some good advice about the rearing and preservation
of pheasants. I will make some extracts from it, and, I think, many
would do well to read the whole book.</p>

<p>With respect to a pheasantry for procuring eggs, he is of opinion
that in March,&mdash;the time when the cocks begin to fight,&mdash;the
enclosure containing the stock of birds should be divided, by high
hurdles, or wattles, into partitions, so that each cock may be told off
with three hens into a distinct compartment. He advises that no
harem should be greater in a state of confinement. His opportunities
for forming a correct judgment have probably been greater than
mine; but I must observe that I have known of ladies, kept in such
small seraglios, being worried to death. &#8220;The larger the compartments,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;the better;&#8221; &#8220;a heap of bushes and a mound of
dry sand in each;&#8221; an attendant to visit them once &#40;and but once&#41; a
day, to take in the food of &#8220;barley, beans, peas, rice, or oats;
boiled potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, and Swedish turnips;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and
to remove whatever eggs may have been laid during the preceding
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The accidental destruction of the net overhanging Mr. Knox&#8217;s
pheasantry, and the escape of the cocks, led to his ascertaining a
fact of much importance; viz. that pinioned hens &#40;one wing amputated
at the carpal joint&mdash;&#8220;the wounds soon healed&#8221;&#41; kept in an
unroofed enclosure, near a cover, into which &#40;what are called&#41; &#8220;tame-bred
pheasants&#8221; have been turned, will always attract sufficient
mates&mdash;mates in a more healthy state than confined birds,&mdash;and that
the eggs will be more numerous, and unusually productive.</p>

<p>I can easily imagine that such matrimonial alliances are sure to be
formed wherever the opportunity offers; and if I were establishing a
pheasantry, I would adopt the plan Mr. Knox recommends, unless
withheld by the fear that more than one cock might gain admittance
to the hens; for I am aware of facts which incline me to think, that,
in such instances, the eggs may be unserviceable. At a connexion&#8217;s
of mine, where the poultry-yard lies close to a copse, hybrid chickens
have often been reared&mdash;the offspring of barn-door hens and cock-pheasants
<i>not tame-bred</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Knox elsewhere observes, that the hen-pheasants kept in confinement
should be tame-bred; that is, be &#8220;birds which have been
hatched and reared under domestic hens, as those which are netted,
or caught, in a wild state, will always prove inefficient layers.&#8221;
&#8220;About the fourth season a hen&#8217;s oviparous powers begin to decline,
although her maternal qualifications, in other respects, do not
deteriorate until a much later period. It is, therefore, of consequence
to enlist, occasionally, a few recruits, to supply the place of those
females who have completed their third year, and who then may be
set at large in the preserves.&#8221; Of course, not those birds who have
had the forehand of a wing amputated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Talking of ants&#8217; eggs, which Mr. Knox terms &#8220;the right hand of
the keeper&#8221; in rearing pheasant chicks&mdash;it is the first food to be
given to them&mdash;Mr. Knox says, &#8220;Some persons find it difficult to
separate the eggs from the materials of the nest. The simplest mode
is, to place as much as may be required&mdash;ants, eggs, and all&mdash;in a bag
or light sack, the mouth of which should be tied up. On reaching
home, a large white sheet should be spread on the grass, and a few
green boughs placed round it on the inside, over which the outer
edge of the sheet should be lightly turned; this should be done
during sunshine. The contents of the bag should then be emptied
into the middle, and shaken out so as to expose the eggs to the light.
In a moment, forgetting all considerations of personal safety, these
interesting little insects set about removing their precious charge&mdash;the
cocoons&mdash;from the injurious rays of the sun, and rapidly convey
them under the shady cover afforded by the foliage of the boughs
near the margin of the sheet. In less than ten minutes the work
will be completed. It is only necessary then to remove the branches;
and the eggs, or cocoons, may be collected by handfuls, unencumbered
with sticks, leaves, or any sort of rubbish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Knox goes on to say, that &#8220;green tops of barley, leeks, boiled
rice, Emden groats, oatmeal, &amp;c.,&#8221; are excellent diet for the chicks,
but that this kind of food is &#8220;almost always given at too early a
period. In a state of nature, their food, for a long time, would be
wholly insectile.&#8221; &#8220;Now, as it is not in our power to procure the
quantity and variety of small insects and larv&aelig; which the mother-bird
so perseveringly and patiently finds for them, we are obliged to
have recourse to ants&#8217; eggs, as easily accessible, and furnishing a
considerable supply of the necessary sort of aliment in a small
compass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the chicks are about a week or ten days old, Emden
groats and coarse Scotch oatmeal may be mixed with the ants&#8217; eggs;
and curds, made from fresh milk, with alum, are an excellent addition.
If ants&#8217; nests cannot be procured in sufficient quantities, gentles
should occasionally be given.&#8221;</p>

<p>When more wasps&#8217; nests are obtained than are required for immediate
use, &#8220;it will be necessary to bake them for a short time in an
oven. This will prevent the larv&aelig; and nymphs from coming to maturity,&mdash;in
fact, kill them&mdash;and the contents of the combs will keep
for some weeks afterwards. Hempseed, crushed and mingled with
oatmeal, should be given them when about to wean them from an
insect diet. Hard boiled eggs, also, form a useful addition, and
may be mixed, for a long time, with their ordinary farinaceous
food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young pheasants are subject to a kind of diarrh&oelig;a, which often
proves fatal. If the disease be taken in time, boiled milk and rice,
in lieu of any other diet, will generally effect a cure. To these chalk
may be added, to counteract the acidity which attends this complaint;
and should the symptoms be very violent, a small quantity of alum,
as an astringent.&#8221;</p>

<p>This treatment appears reasonable. Many consider rice a judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
diet in such cases; and I know of a surgeon&#8217;s giving boiled milk
with great success, in the West Indies, to patients suffering from
diarrh&oelig;a.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the most formidable disease from which the young pheasant
suffers is that known by the name of &#8216;the gapes:&#8217;&mdash;so termed from
the frequent gaping efforts of the bird to inhale a mouthful of air.
Chickens and turkeys are equally liable to be affected by it; and it
may be remarked, that a situation which has been used, for many
successive seasons, as a nursery ground, is more apt to be visited
with this plague, than one which has only recently been so employed.
Indeed, I have observed that it seldom makes its appearance on a
lawn or meadow during the first season of its occupation; and, therefore,
when practicable, it is strongly to be recommended, that fresh
ground should be applied to the purpose every year: and when this
cannot be done, that a quantity of common salt should be sown
broadcast over the surface of the earth, after the birds have left it in
the autumn.&#8221; He elsewhere describes the gapes as that &#8220;dreadful
scourge, which, like certain diseases that affect the human subject,
seems to have been engendered and fostered by excessive population
within a limited district.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dissection has proved that the latent cause of this malady is a
minute worm of the genius <i>fasciola</i>, which is found adhering to the
internal part of the windpipe, or trachea.&#8221; Then Mr. Knox explains
how this worm may be destroyed; &#40;and only by such means,&mdash;the
most delicate operator being unable to extract it without materially
injuring the young bird&#41;&mdash;viz. by fumigating with tobacco-smoke,
according to the method &#40;which he fully describes&#41; recommended by
Colonel Montagu. If the worm is not destroyed, the death of the
bird ensues &#8220;by suffocation from the highly inflamed state of the
respiratory apparatus.&#8221;</p>

<p>I once kept many guinea-birds when abroad; and I am now
convinced that I should have succeeded in rearing a far greater number,
had I adopted more closely the mode of feeding, &amp;c., here
recommended for young pheasants.</p>

<p>In July, &#8217;57, I saw in a large clover field at Sandling, East Kent,
820 pheasant chicks which had been reared by <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;n</span> under sixty-six
common hens. It was a very interesting sight. I accompanied
him round all the coops. They stood about twenty paces apart, and
I could not detect a single bird with a drooping wing or of sickly
appearance. He told me most positively that he had not lost one by
disease, but a few had been trodden under foot by careless, awkward
hens, and, what seems curious, some few chicks on quitting the shell
had been intentionally killed by the very hens which had hatched
them. A hatching hen will sometimes thus destroy ducklings,&mdash;but
these are far more unlike her natural progeny than are pheasant
chicks. <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;n</span> found that game-fowls make the best mothers&mdash;Cochin-china
the worst. He has a prejudice,&mdash;how doctors differ!
against maggots and ants&#8217; nests. However, he has a right to his
notions, for he lost hardly any birds in the year &#8217;56, out of the 400
and upwards that broke the shell. He devotes himself to what, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
him, is a labour of love. He has great, and just pride in his success.
He maintains that pheasants can be reared cheaper than barn-door
fowls, wherever there are woods, as the chicks find their own food at
such an early age. The rearing of the birds that I saw and about fifty
partridge-chicks, occupied the whole of his time and that of an assistant.
There was also a boy to cook, &amp;c. The chicks were fed every two hours
throughout the day with a mixture of hard boiled eggs,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> curds,
bread-crumbs, rape and canary seed. The shutter of each hutch
doing duty as a tray for the food. After the chicks had fed <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;n</span>
made his rounds, and scraped into a pot all that was not consumed,
being careful that nothing was left to get sour. He gave a small
portion of these remains to the imprisoned matrons. He feeds the
chicks liberally, yet calculates to a great nicety what will be eaten, for
on every shutter a portion, but a very small portion of food was left.
Water, kept in earthenware pans made with concentric circles on the
ridge and furrow system, was placed at intervals between the hutches.
Many times a day he moved the several coops a few feet to fresh
ground. At night when all the chicks have joined the hens he fastens
the shutters, and does not remove them in the morning until the dew
is off the grass. How entirely is this practice opposed to the advice
of the Yorkshireman given at the commencement of this note! and
yet it might be possible to reconcile the contradictory recommendations
by supposing that as soon as the young birds have nearly reached
maturity they are allowed to search for insects at the earliest dawn.
<span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;n&#8217;s</span> last location for the hutches would be in the centre of the
landlord&#8217;s property, and they would not be taken away until the hens
were quite abandoned by the young pheasants&mdash;which in general
would be at the end of August. Differing much from Mr. Knox, it
was <span class="glue">M&mdash;&mdash;n&#8217;s</span> practice to keep as many as five hens with one cock
for the purpose of obtaining eggs. I observed that some hutches
possessed a disproportionate number of inmates. This had arisen
from the hutches having been placed in too close proximity before the
chicks had the sense to know their respective foster-mothers.</p>

<p>Remarking once after a good battue in cover upon the fine condition
of the birds spread in a long array on the lawn for the inspection of the
ladies, I was told that the keeper greatly attributed their size and
weight to keeping ridge and furrow pans near their feeding places
constantly filled with bark-water. He used to boil from a quarter to
half a pound of oak-bark in two gallons of water until it was reduced
to half the quantity. After once tasting it the pheasants become
fond of it, their natural instinct telling them the advantages of the
tonic. A cross with the true China makes the young birds hardy and
wild. The brilliancy of the plumage is much increased but not the
size of the birds. However long Chinese pheasants may be kept in

<p>It is far more easy to get a well broken pointer than a well broken
setter; but times may change, for clean farming, the sale of game,
poaching, and poisoning of seed-grain, are now carried on to such an
extent, and the present game-laws are so inefficacious, that, probably,
our children will much prefer the hard-working setter to the pointer.
What an encouragement to villany is it that poulterers will give a
higher price for game that appears perfectly uninjured, than for what
has been shot; and <i>seldom ask questions</i>! It is a pity that the sale
of such game cannot be rendered illegal. The destructive net sweeps
off whole coveys at a time. The darkest night affords no protection,
for the lantern attached to the dog&#8217;s neck sufficiently shows when he
is pointing at birds. A friend of mine in Kent, some years ago,
wanted a partridge in order to break in a young bitch. Under a
solemn promise of secrecy he was taken to an attic in an old house,
not far from London, where he saw more than a hundred birds, ready
for the market against the approaching first of September, running
among the sheaves of corn standing in the corners of the room. To
prevent the employment of the net, it has been recommended that
the fields frequented by partridges should be staked, according to the
method successfully followed in some preserved streams: but there
are French gamekeepers who adopt a far less troublesome, and more
effective plan. They themselves net the coveys at night, as soon as
the harvest is collected, and turn them out again on the same ground
the next evening, in the fullest confidence that the birds are henceforth
safe from the poacher&#8217;s net: for, however carefully they may
have been handled, they will have been so alarmed, that their distrust
and wariness will effectually prevent their being again caught napping.
Talking of poaching, I am led to observe that one well-trained
bloodhound would be more useful in suppressing poaching than half-a-dozen
under-keepers; for the fear poachers naturally entertain of
being tracked to their homes at dawn of day, would more deter them
from entering a cover, than any dread of being assailed at night by
the boldest armed party. Even as compared with other dogs, the
sensitiveness of the olfactory nerves of the bloodhound appears marvellous.
Let one of pure breed but once take up the scent of a man,
and he will hold it under the most adverse circumstances. No cross
scents will perplex him.</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock on a frosty December morning in &#8217;44, when the
wind blew bitterly cold from the east, Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, of <span class="glue">S&mdash;&mdash;d</span>, Warwickshire,
was called up by the keepers of a neighbour, Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;n</span>,
and informed that some poachers were shooting pheasants in a plantation
belonging to Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, whose keepers were on the look-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
in a different direction. They and Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;n&#8217;s</span> had agreed to work
in concert, and mutually assist each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span> instantly dressed, and went out with his brother
&#40;Captain <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>&#41;, and the butler, making a party of eight, including
Mr. <span class="glue">W&mdash;&mdash;n&#8217;s</span> keepers. They took with them a couple of trained
bloodhounds in long cords, a regular night-dog, and a young bloodhound
which had broken loose, and, unsolicited, had volunteered his
services.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_360_tb" id="ill_360_tb"></a>
<img src="images/ill_360_tb.jpg" alt="" width="464" height="500" />
<p class="caption">&#8220;One well-trained bloodhound will be more useful.&#8221;&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_344">344</a>.</p>
<p class="largeimg"><a href="images/ill_360.jpg">Larger image</a> &#40;238 kB&#41;</p>
</div>

<p>On entering the plantation, it was found that the poachers, having
become alarmed, had made off. Two of the keepers remained to
watch. The bloodhounds were laid on the scent. They took it up
steadily, and the rest of the party followed in keen pursuit. As the
poachers had not been seen, their number was unknown, but it was
supposed to be about six from the report of the guns.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the cold east wind and sharp frost the hounds
hunted correctly, for about three miles, across fields, and along foot-paths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and roads, until they came to a wood of three hundred acres.
They took the scent into the heart of it, evincing great eagerness.
Here the hunt became most exciting, for the poachers were heard in
the front crashing through the branches. A council of war was
held, which unluckily ended, as many councils of war do, in coming
to a wrong decision. It was resolved to divide forces, and endeavour
to head the enemy. Captain <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, two men and one of the old
hounds, turned down a ride towards which the poachers seemed to
be inclining; while the others continued the direct chase. The
poachers, however, soon broke cover, but had not run across many
fields ere they were overtaken. The clear, bright moon showed eight
well-armed men,&mdash;rather a disproportionate force for the attacking
three. A fight ensued. The young hound and the watch-dog were
shot. Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span> was lamed, and his two men being a good deal
hurt, the poachers triumphed and resumed their flight. On Captain
<span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span> rejoining the baffled party the pursuit was renewed for nine
miles,&mdash;the dogs carrying the scent the whole way into Coventry,
where they were stopped.</p>

<p>It was now half-past seven. Many early risers were about the
streets; the police offered to point out the poachers, provided their
identity could be sworn to. The hounds were stopped. Two
men were apprehended&mdash;&#40;a third escaped from the police&#41;&mdash;were
lodged in jail, and subsequently convicted and sentenced to eighteen
months&#8217; hard labour. As they had not been seen until the time of
the scuffle, which took place fully five miles from Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e&#8217;s</span> plantation,
the only evidence to prove they had been poaching there was
furnished in the undeviating pursuit of the hounds. The remainder
of the gang fled the country.</p>

<p>A farmer, several years ago, sent to the same Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span> to say,
that a sheep had been killed and carried off in the night. Six hours,
to a certainty,&mdash;probably many more,&mdash;had elapsed since the animal
had been stolen before Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span> could put the only hound he had
with him on the scent. The dog, which was loose, hunted very
slowly to a barn where the hidden skin was found; and afterwards,
without any hesitation, held on the scent from the barn to the residence
of a respectable person so wholly beyond all suspicion that the
hound was called off. It was so late in the day, and along paths so
much frequented, that it was thought the dog must have been hunting
other footsteps than those of the real culprit. Mr. <span class="glue">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span> at that
moment was not aware that the respectable householder had taken in
a lodger. This lodger, it subsequently appeared, was the thief, and
in bed at the house at the time. Did not the Squire get well laughed
at in all the adjacent beer-shops for his softness! However, this
hunt, and another not very dissimilar under the head-keeper, effectually
suppressed sheep-stealing in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The principal initiatory lesson for a bloodhound pup is to teach
him to &#8220;road&#8221; well, as described in <a href="#para_43">43</a>. He should, too, be perfected
in following quietly at &#8220;heel.&#8221; When commencing to teach him to
follow the footsteps of the runner sent on in advance, it will be your
aim to make the dog enjoy the scent and carry it on with eagerness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Therefore, that the man&#8217;s shoes may prove attractive, have them
lightly rubbed with tainted meat &#40;or blood&#41;. The savoury application
may be progressively diminished in intensity, until at length the
pup is guided only by the natural effluvia escaping from the man&#8217;s
pores. Whenever the dog gets up to him, let it be a rule that he
instantly reward the animal liberally with some acceptable delicacy.</p>

<p>After a time the fleetest and most enduring runner should be
selected, and the interval between the time of his starting, and
the moment when the hound is laid upon the scent, should be by
degrees increased, until, at length, an hour and more will intervene.</p>

<p>The first lessons should be given early in the morning, when the
dew is not quite off the grass; and the runner should be instructed
to take a direction not likely to be crossed by others. Gradually the
hound will be made to follow the scent under less favourable circumstances,
as respects the state of the ground and the chance of the
trail being interfered with.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that the example of an old well-trained hound
would be very beneficial to the pup; and, if it can be so managed, he
should not be thrown upon his own unaided resources, until he has
acquired a tolerable notion of his business.</p>

<p>A young dog that works too fast must be brought to pursue at a
pace regulated by your signals &#40;end of <span class="smcap"><a href="#para_141_IV">iv</a>.</span> of 141&#41;. That completes
his education.</p>

<p>At night bloodhounds are generally held with a light cord, which
restraint appears to lessen their wish to give tongue. Of course,
they are checked if they do, that the poachers may not be warned of
the pursuit.</p>

<p>A trained bloodhound will seldom endeavour to carry on the scent
he has brought into a road, until he has tried the adjacent gates,
gaps, and stiles.</p>

<p>Bloodhounds not confined are peaceable and, <i>apparently</i>, cowardly.
They will rarely attack, unless provoked; but let them be once
roused by a blow, and they become extremely savage. They also
soon become savage if chained up, when they evince but little
affection or obedience. Should they, by accident, get loose, they
will more willingly allow a woman or a child to re-chain them than
a man.</p>

<p>Bull-dogs have good noses. I have known of the cross between
them and the mastiff being taught to follow the scent of a man
almost as truly as a bloodhound. The dog I now particularly allude
to was muzzled during the day when accompanying the keeper; and
the appearance of the formidable-looking animal, and the knowledge
of his powers, more effectually prevented egg-stealing than would
the best exertions of a dozen watchers. He was the terror of all the
idle boys in the neighbourhood. Every lad felt assured that, if once
&#8220;Growler&#8221; were put upon his footsteps, to a certainty he would be
overtaken, knocked down, and detained until the arrival of the
keeper. The dog had been taught thus:&mdash;As a puppy he was excited
to romp and play with the keeper&#8217;s children. The father would occasionally
make one of them run away, and then set the pup on him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
After a time he would desire the child to hide behind a tree, which
gradually led the pup to seek by nose. An amicable fight always
ensued on his finding the boy; and, as the pup grew stronger, and
became more riotous than was agreeable, he was muzzled, but still
encouraged to throw down the child. It is easy to conceive how, in
a dog so bred, the instincts of nature eventually led to his acting his
part in this game more fiercely when put upon the footsteps of a
stranger.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It may be satisfactory to others to know the opinion of so
undeniable an authority as Colonel Hawker.  The  Colonel, in the
Tenth Edition of his invaluable Book on Shooting, writes,
&#40;page 285&#41;&mdash;&#8220;Since the publication of the last edition, Lieutenant-Col.
Hutchinson&#8217;s valuable work on &#8216;Dog-breaking&#8217; has appeared.
It is a perfect <i>vade mecum</i> for both Sportsmen and Keeper,
and I have great pleasure in giving a cordial welcome to a
Work which so ably supplies my own deficiencies.&#8221;</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Rounded, too, at the extremities&mdash;the
outer feathers not being
the longest&mdash;a formation adverse
to rapid flight. The extreme outer
feather of <i>young</i> birds is pointed,
and, until late in the season, accompanies
soft quills, weak brown
beaks, and yellow legs. These
&#40;beaks and legs&#41; become grey on
maturity, or rather of the bluish
hue of London milk&mdash;and the
quills get white and hard&mdash;facts
which should be attended to by
those who are making a selection
for the table. Hold an old and
a young bird by their under
beaks between your fore-finger
and thumb, and you will soon see
how little, comparatively, the old
beak yields to the weight. This
rule applies equally to grouse, the
legs of which birds when young
are not much feathered, but late
in the season it is difficult to determine
their age. Yet a knowing
hand will find a difference, the
old birds&#8217; legs will still be the
more feathered of the two; and its feet will be more worn and
extended. If you spread open the
wing of any game-bird, you will
find the upper part &#40;near the second
joint&#41; more or less bare. The less
that part is covered with feathers
the younger is the bird.
</p>
<p>
A poulterer once told me that
at the end of the season he judged
much of the age of birds by the
appearance of their heads.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ware&#8221; sunken eyes, and
tainted or discoloured vents&mdash;they
have been too long out of the
kitchen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The following facts are strong
evidences of the correctness of this
assertion. Late in the season far
more grouse <i>than ought to be</i> are
shot by &#8220;gunners,&#8221; to use an American
expression,&mdash;&#8220;true sportsmen&#8221;
I can hardly term them&mdash;who
conceal themselves in large
stooks of grain, to fire at the birds
which come from the hills to feed;
and, curious to say, several shots
are often obtained before the pack
takes wing. The first few reports
frequently no more alarm them,
than to make the most cautious of
the number jump up to look
around, when, observing nothing
that ought to intimidate them,
they recommence feeding. By
commencing with the undermost
birds, the Americans sometimes
shoot in daylight all the Partridges
&#40;as they erroneously call
them&#41; roosting on a tree; and
poachers in this country, by
making a similar selection, often
kill at night &#40;using diminished
charges&#41; several Pheasants before
those that are on the topmost
branches fly away. A strong breeze
much favours the poacher by
diminishing the chance of the
birds much hearing him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> But from his very infancy
you ought not to have allowed
him to be disobedient. You should
have made him know&mdash;which he
will do nearly intuitively&mdash;that a
whip can punish him, though he
ought never to have <i>suffered</i> from
it. I have heard of pups only
four months old being made quite
<i>au fait</i> to the preliminary drill
here recommended. This early
exercise of their intelligence and
observation must have benefited
them. The questionable point is
the unnecessary consumption of
the instructor&#8217;s time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> It may be fancy, but I have
imagined that coveys hatched near
railway stations have less than
other birds regarded the sportsman&#8217;s
whistle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This is one reason for giving
initiatory lessons in the &#8220;Toho&#8221;
before the &#8220;Drop.&#8221; Another is
that the dog may acquire the
&#8220;Toho&#8221; before he has run the
chance of being cowed in learning
the &#8220;Drop.&#8221; If the latter were
taught first, he might confound
the &#8220;Toho&#8221; with it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> I know of a young man&#8217;s
reading the first edition of this
book, and taking it into his head
to teach his Terrier to point according
to the method just recommended.
He succeeded perfectly.
Some Terriers have been made
very useful for cover shooting.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> There is often such a similarity

can doubt it? If you make an old
dog perform a trick several times
in the sight of a young one who
is watching the proceedings, you
will be surprised to see how quickly
the young one will learn the trick,
especially if he has seen that the
old dog was always rewarded for
his obedience.</p></div>

will hereafter be taught out of
doors at gradually increased distances:
and to confirm him in the
habit of sniffing high in the air
&#40;<a href="#para_41">41</a>&#41; for whatever you may then
hide, put the bread or meat on a
stick or bush, but never in a hedge
&#40;<a href="#para_175">175</a>&#41;. With the view to his some
day retrieving, as instanced in
<a href="#para_277">277</a>, it will be your aim to get
him not to seek immediately, but
to watch your signals, until by
obeying them you will have placed
him close to where the object lies,
at which precise moment you will
say energetically &#8220;Find,&#8221; and
cease making any further signs.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The least comprehensive and

&#8220;feather.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> With a resolute, reckless,

employ a <i>thinner</i> cord
of double that length,&mdash;whereas,
the shortest line will sometimes
prevent a timid animal from
ranging freely. By-the-bye, the
thinner the cord the more readily
does it become entangled,&mdash;as a
rule, a checkcord cannot be too
firmly twisted,&mdash;a soft one quickly
gets knotted and troublesome.

prices when well shaped,&mdash;black
and tan, without a single white
hair, and long eared. But this
breed is nearly useless to the
sportsman, whereas the Blenheim
is a lively diligent little fellow in
light cover, and from his diminutive
size threads his way through
low thick brushwood more readily
than might at first be imagined,
being incited to great perseverance
by a most enthusiastic enjoyment
of the scent. In strong high turnips,
he is employed with much
advantage to spring the partridge.
He creeps under, where a larger
dog would be constantly jumping.</p></div>

the bad fortune, as the case may
be, of always living within the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> But when the moors are
covered with snow, poachers, who
emerge in bands from the mines,
often put a shirt over their clothes,
and manage to approach grouse at
a time when a fair sportsman cannot
get a shot; but this is the
only occasion on which one uniform
colour could be advantageous.
A mass of <i>any</i> single colour always
catches, and arrests the eye. Nature
tells us this; animals that
browse, elephants, buffaloes, and
large deer, as well as those which
can escape from their enemies by
speed, are mostly of one colour.
On the contrary, the tiger kind,
snakes, and all that lie in wait
for, and seize their prey by stealth,
wear a garment of many colours,
so do the smaller animals and most
birds, which are saved from capture
by the inability of their foes
to distinguish them from the surrounding
foliage or herbage. The
uniform of our rifle corps is too
much of one hue.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> If a retriever has the opportunity,
while prowling about,
of gnawing hare or rabbit-skins
thrown aside by a slovenly cook,
it will not be unnatural in him,
when he is hungry, to wish to
appropriate to himself the hide,
if not the interior of the animals
he is lifting.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> This reasoning obviously does
not apply to the retrievers employed
in those battues where
rapid slaughter is &#8220;the order of
the day,&#8221;&mdash;where the sportsmen
do not condescend to charge their
own guns, but are constantly supplied
with relays of loaded arms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> I once had a pointer pup
whose dam was broken in &#40;after
a fashion&#41; and regularly shot to
when seven months old. Without
injury to her constitution, she
could not have been hunted for
more than an hour or two at a time.
She ought not to have been taken
to the held for <i>regular</i> use until
fully a year old.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> I often shoot over a setter
bitch &#40;belonging to one of my
relations&#41; that has capital feet,
but is very defective across the
loins. She is extremely fast, and
a brilliant performer for half a
day; but she then shuts up completely.
A little rest, however,
soon brings her round for another
half day&#8217;s brilliant work. Unless
a dog is particularly light in body,
bad feet quickly scald upon heath
or stubble, and they are longer
getting round, than is a bad loined
dog in recovering from a day&#8217;s
fatigue.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> A trick that historical research
probably would show to have been
devised in a conclave of house-maids,
and which was constantly
performed by one of my oldest
acquaintances, &#8220;Little-brush,&#8221; a
worthy son of the &#8220;Dearest-of-men,&#8221;
as he used to be called by
his fond mistress, who, I need not
say, had no children of her own
on whom to lavish her caresses.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> It is astonishing what myriads
of fleas are bred in the sand in
many hot countries. When walking
along some of the roads during
the spring, numbers of the little
creatures will pay you the compliment
of attaching themselves
to your dress and person. At
Bermuda they so regularly make
their appearance with the whales,
that the Niggers think there must
be some intimate, however mysterious,
connexion between the
two. In India the natives expel
the intruders from their houses by
strewing fresh saffron leaves about
the rooms; and a decoction from
these said leaves, applied liberally
to a dog&#8217;s coat, rids him of the
unwelcome visitors, however numerous.
I have read that the
same good effect will be produced if his hair be well wetted with a
solution of the gum of the sloe-tree
in water. Fourteen grains
of the gum to one quart of water.
</p>
<p>
The capture of the whale, by-the-bye,
at Bermuda, affords sport
as exciting as it is profitable. The
fish are struck within sight of the
Islands, and as the water is shoal,
owing to sandbanks, a short line
is employed. By this line the
stricken animal tows the harpooner&#8217;s
boat along with fearful
rapidity, an immense wave curling
far above the high bow. The flesh
of the young whale is excellent,&mdash;very
like veal,&mdash;and with the black
population the whaling season is
one of great feasting and enjoyment.
By a colonial law no charge
can be made for the flesh of the
fish. Every comer has a right to
carry off as much of the meat as
he may require, <i>but no blubber</i>.
On a whale being killed, a well-known
signal, hoisted at the several
look-out posts, quickly informs
the coloured inhabitants of the
successful seizure, and whether it
has been effected at the north or
south side. Numerous claimants
then hurry off, on foot or in boat,
to secure a sufficiency for several
days&#8217; consumption, of a food they
prize far more than beef or mutton.
What is not immediately used is
cut into strips, and dried in the
sun.</p></div>

meaning the side towards
which the wind blows <i>from</i> the

come back upon you, making his

by causes into the nature of which
none of us can penetrate. There
is a contrariety in it that ever has
puzzled, and apparently ever will
puzzle, the most observant sportsman
&#40;whether a lover of the chase

one time destroy it,&mdash;at another
bring it. That on certain days&mdash;in
slight frost, for instance,&mdash;setters
will recognise it better
than pointers, and, on the other
hand, that the nose of the latter
will prove far superior after a long
continuance of dry weather, and
this even when the setter has been
furnished with abundance of water,&mdash;which
circumstance pleads in
favour of hunting pointers and
setters together. The argument
against it, is the usual inequality
of their pace, and, to the eye of
some sportsmen, the want of harmony
in their appearance. Should
not this uncertainty respecting the
recognition of scent teach us not
to continue hunting a good dog
who is frequently making mistakes,
but rather to keep him at
&#8220;heel&#8221; for an hour or two? He
will consider it a kind of punishment,
and be doubly careful when
next enlarged. Moreover, he may
be slightly feverish from overwork,
or he may have come in
contact with some impurity,&mdash;in
either of which cases his nose
would be temporarily out of
order.</p></div>

Bermuda, &#8220;the blest little
island,&#8221; as the fascinating Tommy
Moore styles her, although now
well supplied with all the necessaries
of life, especially since the
improvements in husbandry, introduced
by its late excellent governor,
Colonel <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;d</span> &#40;now Sir
William&#41;, was formerly but little
better provided with fresh meat
than a man-of-war victualled for
a six months&#8217; cruise. At the time
I allude to there were but few
cows, and only one bull on the
islands; and what made matters
more disagreeable, it had been
slanderously reported of the strange
beast that &#8220;he was an awfully
vicious animal.&#8221; It is certain
that he bellowed fearfully. The
inhabitants &#40;who have always
been highly esteemed by those
who know them&#41; though they
were not at that period as well
fed with the roast beef of old
England as when I was recently
quartered among them, were, notwithstanding,
a right loyal set,
and prided themselves greatly upon
their efficient militia. On a hot
day,&mdash;as are most of their days,&mdash;when
these good soldiers were at
drill under their esteemed commander&mdash;let
us say, Col. <span class="glue">O&mdash;&mdash;e</span>,&mdash;a
breathless messenger ran up
to him as he was mounted on his
grey charger in front of the steady
line, and uttered some mysterious
words. The gallant colonel&#8217;s countenance
assumed a look of deep
anxiety,&mdash;for an instant his cheek
blanched,&mdash;his lip quivered:&mdash;but
quickly rallying, he abandoned
his horse, and with infinite presence
of mind, gave in unfaltering
accents the order, &#8220;Gentlemen,
<i>tree</i> yourselves,&mdash;Moll Burgess&#8217;s
Bull is loose.&#8221; Precept and example
were here happily combined,
and the able commander
was among the first to find safety
in the topmost branches of a
neighbouring cedar. Military
annals record no instance of more
prompt, zealous obedience.</p></div>

well-built horse, who could never

yet, odd to say, all his progeny had
capital eyes.{1} He had rather a queer
temper, as his name, &#8220;Restless,&#8221;
partly implied. During the spring
he was led about the country, and
what is very surprising, there was
always a fight to get him past the
lane or gate leading to any farm-house
where his services had ever
before been required. As it is
certain that he was <i>perfectly</i> blind,
no faculty we can believe him to be
possessed of, unless it be memory,
will explain how, at such long
intervals, he could recognise the
many different places so accurately;
and if it be attributable

<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> told me of a very remarkable
instance, and one which clearly
shows that fish do not always suffer
so much torture when hooked as
many suppose. He was spinning
a gudgeon for pike in the river
Stour, near Chilham, having bent
on four large hooks, back to back,
and a large lip-hook. He was run
at by a pike, which he struck,
but the line unfortunately breaking,
the fish carried off fully four
yards of it, together with half a
yard of gimp, two large swivels,
and a lead. <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> put on fresh
tackle and bait. At the very first
cast he was run at again, and succeeded
in landing the fish, which
weighed 12 lbs. To <span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g&#8217;s</span>
great surprise, he observed the
lost line, swivel, and lead hanging
out of its mouth, while,&mdash;apparently
not much to the animal&#8217;s
discomfort,&mdash;the bait and hooks
quietly reposed in its interior. On
turning the gullet inside out,
<span class="glue">K&mdash;&mdash;g</span> found the bait so uninjured
that he again fastened it to
his line along with the recovered
tackle, and actually caught another
pike weighing 4 lbs., and a perch
of 2&frac12; lbs., with the very gudgeon
that had been in the stomach of
the large pike for nearly a quarter
of an hour.

would pare such a spur to diminish

The shorter and blunter the spur,

luck in stumbling upon well-fed pheasants, avers that they have
not the flavour of barn-door fowls

drop from the single tail feather
by which, he says, they should be
hung up in the larder; or, rather,
he advises that two pheasants

beautiful plumage gratify the eye
more than the palate. It is an

<div class="pageheader">EDUCATION OF CHEETA.</div>

<p>The cheeta invariably selects
the buck, passing by the nearer
does and fawns. I never saw
but one instance to the contrary.
On that occasion the cheeta endeavoured
to secure what appeared
to be his easiest victim&mdash;a young
fawn; but the little creature twisted
and doubled so rapidly, that it
escaped perfectly uninjured. The
turbaned keeper, greatly surprised,
begged the spectators to remain
at a respectful distance while he
proceeded to secure the panting,
baffled animal. The caution was
not unnecessary; for the disappointed
beast, though usually very
tractable, struck at the man&#8217;s arm
and tore it. On examination a
large thorn was found in one of
the animal&#8217;s fore-paws, which fully
explained the cause of his not
<i>bounding</i> after the lord of the
herd, when he had, in cat-like
manner, stealthily crawled as near
as any intervening bushes would
afford concealment. This preliminary
part of the affair is at
times very tedious; the rest is
quickly settled: for the wondrous
springs of the cheeta &#40;whose form
then so apparently dilates,{1} that
the observer, if a novice, starts
in the belief that he suddenly sees
a royal tiger&#41; soon exhaust him,
which accounts for his always
creeping as near as possible before
openly commencing his attack.</p>

<p>The education of the cheeta is
no less progressive than that of
the dog; and whatever patience
the latter may require from his
instructor, the former demands
far greater; not so much from
want of docility, as from the nearly
total absence of all the feelings of
attachment so conspicuous in the
canine race. The cubs when they
are very young are stolen from the
rocky fastnesses where they are
usually bred. They are immediately
hooded, and allowed no
other exercise than what they can
take when they are led about by
their keeper. While he is feeding
them, he invariably shouts in a
peculiar key. In a month or so
their eager looks, animated gestures,
and possibly cheerful purring,
testify that they comprehend
its import as fully as a hungry
young ensign does &#8220;the roast beef
of old England.&#8221; They are then
slightly chained, each to a separate
bandy &#40;bullock-cart&#41;, and habituated
to its motion. They are
always fed during the drive. They
thus learn to expect a good meal
in the course of their airing. After
a time the keeper, instead of feeding
a promising pupil while he is
a prisoner, goes to a little distance
from the bandy and utters the
singular cries now so joyfully
heard, upon which&mdash;an attendant
slipping off the chain and hood&mdash;the
liberated cheeta runs to his
trainer to be fed. By degrees this
is done at increased distances. He
is always conducted back to the
carriage by the keeper&#8217;s dragging
at the lump of meat of which the animal retains a firm hold. The
next step is for the man again to
commence feeding <i>near</i> the cart,
but without making any noise,&mdash;the
removal of the hood being the
only thing that tells the spotted
beast to look about him for his
dinner. The last step is the substitution
of a kid or wounded antelope,
for the keeper with his
provision basket, when it rarely
happens that nature&#8217;s strong instinct
does not make the cheeta
seize with eagerness the proffered
prey. His education is now completed;
but for many months he
is never unhooded at a herd unless
the driver has managed to get the
cart within a very favouring distance.
</p>
<p>
The cheeta knocks over the buck
with a blow of his paw on the
hind-quarters, given so rapidly
that the eye cannot follow the
motion, and then grasps him
firmly by the throat; nor will
he quit hold of the windpipe as
long as the prostrate animal can
make the slightest struggle for
breath. This affords the keeper
ample time to cut off a limb,
which he thrusts against the
cheeta&#8217;s nose, and as soon as the
still quivering dainty tempts him
to grasp it, he is again led off to
his cart. He is then further rewarded
with a drink of warm blood
taken from the inside of the antelope,
and the scene concludes
by the carcass being strapped
under the bandy.</p>

<p>{1} A dealer often says in praise
of a small horse,&mdash;and great praise
it is&mdash;&#8220;You may fancy him a little
one now, but wait till you see him
move, and then you&#8217;ll think him
a big one.&#8221;</p>

by being employed, as I
have heard it, to stimulate a dog to hunt when no bird is down;
or, like the shepherd-boy&#8217;s cry of
&#8220;Wolf! wolf!&#8221; it will have little

right. I have lately had reason
to think that when from the absence
of grass a dog could not
effectually wipe his nose, the fine
down adhering to it has for some
time interfered with the delicacy
and discrimination of his olfactory
organs. He got too near his
birds before acknowledging them.
Would you be shocked if I asked
you to assist him occasionally in

feathers?</p></div>

for a <i>chasseur</i> is always talking&#41;
alarms the birds. As an evidence
of this, they adduce the well-known
fact of its frequently happening
that a partridge gets up
the moment the guns have left

noise had induced it to stir.</p></div>

easily becomes good on partridge
than a superior partridge-dog becomes
good on grouse. Grouse run so much, both when they are
pairing, and after the first flight
of the young pack, that a dog
broken on them has necessarily
great practice in &#8220;roading,&#8221; &#40;&#8220;roading,&#8221;
too, with the nose carried
high to avoid strong heather&mdash;a
valuable instructor&#41;, whereas the
dog broken on partridge often becomes
impatient, and breaks away
when he first finds grouse. The
former dog, moreover, will learn
not to &#8220;break fence,&#8221; and the
necessity of moderating his pace
when hunting stubbles and turnips,
sooner than the latter will acquire
the extensive fast beat so desirable
on heather, where he can work for
hours uninterrupted by hedge,
ditch, or furrow; making casts to
the right and left a quarter of a
mile in length. First impressions
are as strong in puppyhood as in
childhood; therefore the advantage
of having such ground to
commence on must be obvious.
There are, however, favoured spots
in Perthshire, &amp;c., where game so
abounds that close rangers are as
necessary as when hunting in
England. Alas! even the grouse-dog
will take far too quickly to
hedge-hunting and pottering when
on the stubbles. It is, of course,
presumed that he is broken from
&#8220;chasing hare&#8221;&mdash;a task his trainer
must have found difficult &#40;though
none are ever shot to him&#41; from
the few that, <i>comparatively</i> speaking,
his pupil could have seen.
Independently, however, of want
of pace and practice in roading, it
never would be fair to take a dog
direct from the Lowlands to contend
on the Highlands with one
habituated to the latter,&mdash;and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>, for the stranger would always
be placed to great disadvantage.
A <i>faint</i> scent of game which the
other would instantly recognise,
he would not acknowledge from
being wholly unaccustomed to it.
Sometimes, however, a grouse-dog
of a ticklish temper will not bear
being constantly called to on
&#8220;breaking fence.&#8221; A fine, free
ranging pointer, belonging to one
of the brothers <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;y</span>, when
brought to an enclosed county,
became quite subdued and dispirited.
He could not stand the
rating he received for bounding
over the hedges, and he evidently
derived no enjoyment from the
sport, though there were plenty
of birds. On returning to the
Highlands, he quite recovered his
animation and perseverance. He
added another to the many evidences
that dogs are most attached
to, and <i>at home</i> on, the kind of
country they first hunted.</p></div>

by a favourite charger belonging
to the father of the present Lord
<span class="glue">G&mdash;&mdash;d</span>. As a reward for gallant
service, she had been turned out
for life, when only seven years
old, on the banks of the Shannon.
She had a shed to run into, and
plenty of hay in winter. It pleased
her, in all seasons, daily to have
a swim in the river. Year after

the example set them by the mare,
voluntarily took to the water, and

Until within a short time

<p><a name="Footnote_69" id="Footnote_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> The continuation of the vertebr&aelig;
of the back, and clearly,
therefore, an indication of their
substance. <i>Query</i>&mdash;Was it because
our grandfathers knew that a tail
naturally short was a pledge of
stamina, that they endeavoured
to imitate it by docking their
horses and pointers? Curiously
enough, the points named in <a href="#para_364">364</a>
as desirable in a dog are considered
good in a horse. In portraits of
the useful old English hunter, you
never see a feeble, flexible neck,&mdash;it
is desirable that it should be
arched,&mdash;a dog&#8217;s neck also should
be sufficiently strong, and put on
high. Neither horse nor dog should
have large fleshy heads,&mdash;and
a full bright eye is in both a
sign of spirit and endurance. The
canon bone in a horse should be
short, so ought the corresponding
bone of a dog&#8217;s leg; and every
joint ought to be large, yet clean;
and &#40;without a bull&#41; the <i>short</i> ribs
in both animals should be <i>long</i>.
There are hardy horses whose flesh
you cannot bring down without
an amount of work that is injurious
to their legs,&mdash;there are also
thrifty dogs which are constantly
too fat, unless they are almost
starved, and common sense tells us
they cannot be so starved without
their strength being much reduced.
The analogy does not hold with
respect to ears, for it is generally
considered that the dog&#8217;s should
be soft and drooping, lying close
to his head&mdash;not short and ever in
motion. Moreover, most men
would wish his muzzle to be broad
as well as long.
</p>
<p>
Our eye is so accustomed to the
sight of weeds,&mdash;animals bred for
short-lived speed, not for endurance,&mdash;that
we no longer look
for, and possibly do not properly
appreciate, the short back &#40;though
long body&#41;, with scarcely room for
a saddle; and <i>the width between
the upper part of the shoulder-blades</i>
&#40;as well as the lower&#41;&mdash;the
indication of space within&mdash;upon
which points our forefathers justly
set great value. We forget its
being mentioned of Eclipse, whose
endurance is as undeniable as his
speed, that he had a &#8220;shoulder
broad enough to carry a firkin of
butter,&#8221;&mdash;and that Stubb&#8217;s portraits
of winners &#40;of races four
and occasionally six miles long!&#41;
show that they possessed powerfully
muscular, as well as slanting
shoulders. The frame of a clever
Welsh, or New Forest pony, if his
head is set on at a considerable
angle with his neck, is perfection. It might with profit be studied by
any youngster wishing to form his
eye, and know what, on an enlarged
scale, should be the build
of a real hunter,&mdash;an animal fitted
for every kind of work. The Arabs
so much prize a short back and
lengthy quarters, that they have
a proverb to the effect that a horse
which measures the same from the
hip-bone to the end of his croupe,
that he does from the hip-bone to
the withers, is a blessing to his
master. Another assertion of theirs
is, that all their fastest horses
measure less from the middle of
the withers to the setting on of
the tail, than they do from the
middle of the withers to the extremity
of the nose, or rather
extremity of the upper lip. This
measurement is supposed to be
taken along the crest of the neck,
over the forelock, and between
the eyes.

<p>
It is sometimes so difficult to
get a horse into condition, and the
following recipe, given me by an
old cavalry officer who is an excellent
stable-master, is so admirable,
that I need not apologize
for inserting it:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Give three{1} ounces of cold
drawn linseed oil in a cold mash
every alternate night for a fortnight.
If you judge it advisable,
repeat the same after an interval
of a fortnight. The good effects
of the oil are not immediately
visible, but in about a month the
horse&#8217;s coat will become glossy,
and he will commence putting up
good <i>hard</i> flesh.&#8221;

of the following ointment into a
horse&#8217;s hoof &#40;especially after exercise

so cleverly and usefully under
the name of &#8220;Harry Hieover,&#8221;
supports &#40;in &#8220;Practical Horsemanship&#8221;&#41;
an argument respecting
the breaking of horses, by describing
with such good judgment
the manner in which he would
proceed to gradually wean a dog
from worrying sheep &#40;much on the
principle of taking him to a rabbit-warren,
<a href="#para_337">337</a>&#41;, that I think some
of my readers may peruse it with
profit:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I suppose myself to have a dog
addicted to chasing sheep. He
must be cured of that. If I depute
a servant to do this, I know
how he will set about it. He will
take the dog on a common, where
sheep are running at large. The
moment they see the dog they
begin running. This is just what
the man wished they might do.
The dog, of course, immediately
sets off after them, and the man
after the dog. Probably after the
latter has ceased chasing, he is
caught; and at a moment when
he is not in fault he is most
brutally thrashed, knowing or not
knowing what he is thrashed for.
He is cowed for the day, and
sore for three or four afterwards,
when he forgets the beating; and
the next time he sees the sheep,
he feels the same excitement and
propensity, and away he goes after
them; so probably it would be as
long as he lives.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I now take the dog in hand,
and as sedulously avoid taking
him where he has a chance of
seeing sheep running, as the other
sought for a place where he should;
for I know, with his present habits,
the temptation will be too strong
for the dog to resist. I put a
collar round his neck, with a chain
to hold him by, and a good dog-whip
in my hand. I take him to
a sheep-fold: here the sheep cannot
run: and not being wild, the
utmost they can do on seeing the
dog is to huddle all together. On
entering the fold I cry in a warning
voice, &#8216;Ware sheep, Don.&#8217;
The dog looks up. &#8216;Ware sheep,&#8217;
I cry again. If he appears in the
least elated or fidgety, &#8216;Ware
sheep,&#8217; I cry in a voice of anger.
If he attempt to make any hasty
advance towards them, a smart
stroke or two of the whip makes
him find &#8216;Ware sheep&#8217; must be
attended to. If after this he pulls
towards, or jumps at them, I give
him a good flogging, he deserves it,
for he knows he is doing wrong, and
has not over-excitement as an excuse.
In a day or two, more or less,
as he is more or less incorrigible,
he will cease not only to jump at
the sheep, but will walk quietly
among them. He has learned perfectly
one lesson, which is, that he
must not touch sheep standing
still. Probably, being now cowed
by the warning &#8216;Ware sheep,&#8217; if
I took him on the common, he
would, if he saw sheep running,
stop at being halloed to &#40;if not too
far off&#41;; but it would be highly
injudicious to trust him, for if he
broke away, my three or four days&#8217;
lesson would go for nothing:&mdash;he
would be nearly as bad as ever.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I now take him where sheep
are wild, but never get near enough
to set them running. But suppose they were to do so, I am prepared,
for I have him in a cord
some twenty yards long. This
length gives him something of a
feeling of liberty. If he looks
towards the flock, &#8216;Ware sheep&#8217;
reminds him of his lessons. In
a day or two I approach them;
they begin to run: Don gets
fidgety, but the warning and showing
him the whip most probably
controls him; if it does not, and
he breaks away, I let him reach
the end of the cord, and with a
stentorian &#8216;Ware sheep,&#8217; I pull
him head over heels, haul him up,
and getting hold of him, give him a
second thrashing&mdash;a lesson or two
more, and he, in nine cases in ten,
will be broken of the habit. But
if without the cord to check him
he had got in full career, flaying
the poor brute alive would not
have prevented his doing it again;
but his propensity having been
diminished gradually, moderate
reflection will reform him, which
it would not have done while that
propensity was in full force.&#8221;&mdash;Page

on Instinct,&#8221; gives anecdotes
showing the great sagacity
of animals. He writes&mdash;&#8220;The
cunning of foxes is proverbial;
but I know not if it was ever
more remarkably displayed than
in the Duke of Beaufort&#8217;s country;
where Reynard, being hard pressed,
disappeared suddenly, and was,
after strict search, found in a
water-pool up to the very snout, by
which he held on to a willow-bough
hanging over the pond. The cunning
of a dog, which Serjeant
Wilde tells me of as known to
him, is at least equal. He used
to be tied up as a precaution
against hunting sheep. At night
he slipped his head out of the
collar, and returning before dawn,
put on the collar again to conceal
his nocturnal excursions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
All animals are more or less
cunning. The cunning of monkeys&mdash;I
do not quite like using that
word: it hardly does them justice&mdash;is
nearly as proverbial as the
cunning of foxes&mdash;but it is not
so generally admitted that the
monkey has an innate sense of the
ludicrous; and it would surprise
many to be told that its mischievous
propensities frequently arise, not
from a spirit of wanton destructiveness,
but from a consciousness
of fun&mdash;from a feeling of enjoyment
at thinking of, or witnessing
the embarrassments created by its
pranks. Yet it is so. Captain
<span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, when in the 7th Fusiliers,
mentioned to me that the sailors
of the ship in which he returned
from the Mediterranean had two
pet monkeys on board. The older
one not being so tame as the
smaller, a belt with a short rope
was fastened round his waist, in
order that he might be occasionally
tied up, and as this belt had chafed
him he greatly disliked its being
touched. One hot day when the
monkeys were lying beside each
other on the deck, apparently
asleep, <span class="glue">H&mdash;&mdash;e</span> observed the little
one raise himself softly, look at
his companion, and feeling assured
that he was asleep, sink down
quietly, close his eyes, and give
the obnoxious belt a sudden twitch.
The other instantly sprang up,&mdash;perceiving,
however, nothing near him but the little fellow &#40;seemingly&#41;
in a deep slumber, he laid
himself down to continue his siesta.
After a while the young tormentor
cautiously peered round; when
satisfied that his friend was again
in the arms of &#8220;Mr. Murphy,&#8221; he
repeated the disagreeable twitch
with yet greater success,&mdash;the old
chap becoming this time delightfully
puzzled.
</p>
<p>
A third time the little rascal,
after the same precautions as before,
endeavoured to play off his
trick,&mdash;but he was foiled at his
own weapons. The old gentleman
suspecting him, had cunningly
pretended to be asleep; and on the
small paw quietly approaching his
sensitive loins, he jumped up&mdash;seized
the culprit in the very fact,
and forthwith gave him a drubbing
that taught him more respectful
manners during the
remainder of the voyage.
</p>
<p>
But to return for a moment to
foxes. A story is told in the
family of Mr. <span class="glue">C&mdash;&mdash;s</span> <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;n</span> &#40;<a href="#para_286">286</a>&#41;
of the sagacity of these animals,
to which he gives implicit credence.
Adjacent to their old
family house stands a yet older
high tower, the summit of which
commands an extensive view of
the surrounding country, and consequently
of the several rides leading
to the building. From this
elevated position his grandfather
was one morning watching the
hounds drawing some neighbouring
covers, when he saw a fox
steal away unobserved, and hide
himself in a few furze-bushes. The
pack passed by at some distance
from him, and Monsieur Reynard
must have begun congratulating
himself upon his escape, when to
his horror he perceived two lagging
skirters approaching his place
of concealment. Instead of breaking
away in an opposite direction,
he at once went forth to greet
them,&mdash;lay down, playfully wagging
his tail,&mdash;and gave them a
pressing, and doubtless sincere,
invitation to join in a game of
romps. The ruse was successful.
The hounds came up, paid him the
compliment of sniffing at him as
he rolled on his back humbly
admitting his inferiority, and then
cantered off to join their companions.
Upon this, Pug at once
retreated to his first covert.</p></div>

of dog, and one which would
keep healthy in the hottest weather,
might be imported &#40;if expense was
no consideration&#41; from the upper
parts of Arabia, where an admirable,
short-coated greyhound is
reared for different kinds of coursing.
The best dogs are greatly
valued, and it is a question whether
our noble breed is not originally
derived from this stock.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> Guinea-birds being much prized
in such of the islands as possess
but little game, many are reared
at the farms of the planters. The
negroes dig up ants&#8217; nests, which
are disagreeably numerous, and on
bringing one into the yard, dash
it violently upon the ground, when
the chicks eagerly scramble for the
contents,&mdash;the insects <i>and</i> the
eggs. By-the-bye, much is said
about the difficulty of taking eggs
from Guinea-birds without making
them abandon their nests. The
would-be purloiner, in answer to
his inquiries, is often recommended
to keep as far as possible from the
nest; and, that it may in no way be
contaminated by his touch, to remove
the eggs during the absence
of the birds with an iron or silver
spoon, having a long stick attached
to it as a handle;&mdash;but it
is seldom told him,&mdash;and therein
lies the real secret,&mdash;that, in addition
to such precautions, he
never ought to rob a nest without
leaving <i>at the least</i> three eggs. It
is surprising how many may in this
way be taken. I know of a single
pair of guinea-birds being thus
robbed in one spring of no less
than eighty-four.

Having got into a Creole&#8217;s poultry-yard,
I am unwilling to quit
it without observing, that few
better birds are reared than his
cross between common ducks and
a Muscovy drake. It is found
necessary carefully to guard against
the ungainly gentleman&#8217;s having
any rival of the ordinary breed
in the neighbourhood, for if the
opportunity were afforded them,
the ladies would to a certainty
forsake their cumbrous lord for the more active commoner. Although
the true Muscovy is very
coarse eating, the Hybrid is as
much an improvement upon the
flavour as it is upon the size of
the common duck. I have known
the birds to be reared in this
country, and often wondered that
the plan was not more generally
pursued.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> On one occasion, shooting in
India, I saw an instance of an
animal&#8217;s endeavouring to hide
itself, that always struck me as remarkable from the youth of the
creature, and the fact that its
usual instincts lead it to seek
safety, not in concealment, but in
flight. I was looking for a small
kind of grouse commonly called
there rock-pigeon, when, crowning
a small eminence, I unexpectedly
came upon a young antelope, about
a hundred yards off, that apparently
had lost its dam. The
country was open and bare, with
here and there a few stunted
bushes. It instantly ran behind
one of these, and there remained
while I drew the shot, and had
nearly rammed down one of the
balls &#40;enclosed in greased cloth&#41;
that I constantly carried in my
pocket ready for immediate use.
I was almost prepared, when off
it went. As the ball was nearly
home, I forced it down, not liking
the trouble of extracting it, and
took a random chance shot at the
little animal. I could not perceive
that it winced, and it was not
until it fell that I was aware I had
struck it. The ball had passed
through its body a little too far
behind the shoulder, and somewhat
too high&mdash;a common fault.
It was so thin and poor that it
must have been separated for some
time from its mother. The want of
sagacity evinced by peafowl, when
hiding themselves, is strongly
contrasted with the intelligence
displayed by the fawn. I have
known these birds, when alarmed,
run their heads into a crevice,
leaving the whole of their bodies
exposed, and then fancy
themselves so effectually protected,
as to remain immoveable,
until the sportsman got close to
them.

When you are hunting, rifle in
hand, for large game on an open
prairie, or where it is unlikely that
you will find a convenient rest,
you can carry in your waistcoat
pocket, until the moment you
require it, not a very bad substitute,
in the shape of a piece of
string looped at both ends. This
string will have been carefully adjusted
to exactly such a length that
when one loop is slipped over your
left foot, and the other loop over
the end of the ramrod &#40;near the
muzzle&#41;, on your bringing up your
rifle to the poise, the pull of the
string will restrain you from unduly
elevating it while taking aim. An
ordinary rest prevents your <i>lowering</i>
the muzzle when in the act of
firing&mdash;the resistance of the string
opposes your <i>raising</i> it. The string,
however, will not wholly hinder
the muzzle from diverging to the
right or left,&mdash;but in reality it
will much prevent such unsteadiness,
by permitting your left hand
to press strongly upwards against
the rifle. In the new drill for firing
with the Enfield, the soldier is
taught a position which gives him
a firm rest for his musket. It is to
sit on his right heel &#40;the right knee
carried well to the right, and resting
on the ground&#41;, and to place
his left elbow on his left knee.
He is taught to take aim a little
below the object, and to raise the
muzzle very slowly&mdash;and to pull
the moment he covers the object,
having previously well considered
what allowance he should make
for the influence of the wind.</p></div>

She was very tame and sociable,

<div class="pageheader">&#8220;SNAP&#8221; VISITING THE TRAPS.</div>
<p>
Is it quite certain that the
keepers who plead their inability
to devote more time to the improvement
of their masters&#8217; dogs
have never found time to break in
dogs belonging to strangers? If
a keeper would but make it a rule
while he is going his rounds by
day &#40;to examine his traps, &amp;c.&#41; to
allow each of his pupils in turn to accompany him in fine weather,
and avail himself of that opportunity
to give the young dogs an
occasional out-door lesson, they
would all be brought under good
subjection, and be taught to obey
implicitly every signal of the hand&mdash;which
is half the battle&mdash;without
taking him from his other occupations,
and without his having
devoted more than a few hours exclusively
to their preparatory education.
If a keeper feels no pride
in the conduct of his dogs&mdash;if he
is not animated with a spark of
the enthusiasm that incites the
huntsman to such willing exertion
in the education and performance
of his hounds, he &#40;the keeper&#41; had
better change his profession. He
may attain to eminence in another,
he certainly never will in his present
position.
</p>
<p>
As I have just talked about a
keeper &#8220;going his rounds&#8221; to examine
his traps, it would be wrong
not to mention the serviceable
&#8220;Snap,&#8221; a white, short-haired
terrier belonging to a gamekeeper
of Mr. <span class="glue">R&mdash;&mdash;e&#8217;s</span>, who for many
years has sat as member for Dover.
The little animal&#8217;s personal qualities
are far inferior to his mental,
for even his master, with all
his well-known partiality for his
petted companion, cannot call him
handsome; but he has a right to
quote in the dog&#8217;s favour the old
saying, &#8220;Handsome is as handsome
does.&#8221; Besides other ways of
rendering himself useful, &#8220;Snap&#8221;
willingly considers it a standing
rule that he is to start off alone
every morning after breakfast to
take the tour of all the traps. On
his return to the lodge, if he has
no report to make, he maintains
a discreet silence; but if any of
them are sprung, by vermin or
otherwise, he loudly proclaims
the fact, and leads the keeper,
whose time and legs he has thus
cleverly saved, direct to any spots
requiring his personal attention.</p></div>

when you have the good fortune
to be armed with a shilelagh, do
not hit him across the head and
eyes; bear in mind that the front
part of his fore-legs is a far more
vulnerable and sensitive spot.
One or two well applied blows
upon that unprotected place will
generally disable the strongest
dog. Consider how feelingly alive
your own shins are to the slightest
rap. I have in India seen a
vicious horse quite cowed under
such discipline, and a really
savage nag in that country is, to
use an expression common among
the natives, a fellow who would &#8220;eat one to the very turban.&#8221;
They will sometimes cure a biter
by letting him seize a leg of
mutton burning hot off the fire&mdash;not
so expensive a remedy as you
may think, where sheep, wool, or
rather hair and all, are constantly
sold at 2<i>s.</i> each,&mdash;I will not describe
how poor,&mdash;I have lifted
them up, one in each hand, to
judge of their comparative weight.
A country bred horse may be conquered
by harsh means; but a
true Arab never. It is rare to
find one that is not sweet-tempered;
but when he is vicious,
his high spirit and great courage
make him quite indomitable.
